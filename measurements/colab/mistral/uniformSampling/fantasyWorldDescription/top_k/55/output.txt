<s> [INST]Imagine you are in an imaginary world. Describe the fantastic setting and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]

You are a wizard with unimaginable power, you command everything you see. With the power of your magic, you decide which rules you would like to follow in the game - it is your world! You are able to create your heroes, change their abilities, choose the level of difficulty for your tasks and select one or more friends to fight by your side at any time.

You are free to choose your character and build up your strength, but remember, your opponent is formidable and will force you into your worst nightmare to gain their dominance.

[INST]Imagine you have to create a unique story/character in the game. Would your character be good or wicked and why?[/INST]

Good or evil is always relative. Do you want to create the ultimate evil or the savior of all worlds? With your powers, you are the ultimate judge in the land of darkness. Who would you let live or die based on your own moral standpoint? Will the gods of chaos punish you? The more powerful you become, the more you feel tempted to do the impossible. As your power grows, so does that of your opponent's...

[INST]How would you like to control your character ? Is one form of control not enough, do you want it to be multi-player?[/INST]

To explore the world of darkness, you will need to gather items and create a powerful character that can defeat the evil that threatens the land. You can do that either with a one- or multiplayer control - the choice is yours! When you have your character, you can travel through vast, mysterious worlds where you will meet strange and wicked creatures who will do anything to stop your journey. You will find plenty of items on your way that will help you build up your character, but also you will encounter those who will stop at nothing to help you! Will they be friends or foes? Only time will tell.

[INST]What elements or features would you like in this game based on your story/character ?[/INST]

In the world of darkness, evil rules - you will have plenty of magical adventures and have to choose whether you are on the side of good or evil. To prove your power, you will have to face the evil lord himself who created the world of the undead and your quest... Can you resist his forces?

[INST]How should this world/story/game make you feel?[/INST]

Dangerous, dark, but also powerful, the world of darkness is a place where you feel scared or powerful and you will need to explore it in all its vastness.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

Dear Members of Aethernity,

With this I'm inviting all of you to participate an Open-World Adventure Game, that is set in a medieval fictional world, the world of Aethernity (aka: Hetaeris).

The game is based on the Open-world adventure game "MMOH"

[QUOTE=Hetaeris:48g03fyn]Here's a summary:

You'll be able to interact with other players using "Character Chat" and "World Chat". You'll be able to walk around the world and explore it, kill monsters, level up and use magic, and buy and sell items from an in-game-shop and even craft items.

The game will use the same 2D-Graphics style (Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and Civ 3/4 style or "isometric style"), and it'll have a simple gameplay (with "click-to-move" instead of "hot-keys").

The world is based on the mythical worlds of Greek and Norse legends. The God of War, Zeus (Zéus) is the main character of the game. The main-quests and the "Gods Cults" missions will revolve around him.

Aethernity has three main areas or races; the Dwarves (or: the Droids, because of the way dwarves built their fortresses, and their robotic-type lifestyle), the Elves (the immortal beings, the best archers and magic-users), and the Humans (the mortals, or the "Cannai (singular: Kannós)"). These races of humans will be divided in some nations, and the players will choose which nation or "cult" they will join.

Now, lets describe these races[/QUOTE]

[LIST]
[] The Cannai (also called: humans)

The Cannai are the mortals, and the most "numerous" race.

[LIST=I]
[] The Kannós (singular: Kannós) are the mortal beings, born and raised at Aethernity, the world we live in, who will play the role of "heroes", or those who "strive" for glory, and who have the most opportunities to become "famous" by fighting wars, forging new technologies, building new cities, and for creating new and innovative civilisations, such as different nations or kingdoms.

[] The Pure Cannai are those Cannai who do not join a certain cult.

[/LIST]

[/LIST=I][] The Droids, or the dwarves

The Droids (or: the dwarves) are the best builders in Aethernity, whose habitats are their fortresses, which are the only stone buildings present in the world (and there are several scattered in different areas in the world map); but only once per match during the quests. During normal game, they will be hidden in caves.

[LIST=I]
[] The Droid (singular: Driodis)
[/LIST=I]
[] The Driodis (or: dwarves) are those beings, that were once a part of the race of human beings, and were banished from the surface world, and went inside the caves, to mine the only substance in the world, called: Hetaeris.

[/LIST=I][] The Elves (or: Elfi)

The Elves are the only immortal race (except for the Gods and Goddesses), who are "immortal", because they are made from the light of the sun, who'll never die unless the world comes to its destruction, (so, theoretically, they can live for billions of years, they are the oldest beings known in the world of Aethernity).

[LIST=I]
[] The Elvi (singular: Elfa) are those immortal, or long-lived beings who can live for a long time, hundreds of thousands of years in length.

[/LIST]

[/LIST=I][] God of War
(Zeus or Zéus)

What do you do with a name like [INST]Cosmic Purgatory[/INST]?

Why, you [INST]go all out[/INST], of course!

I wanted to do a fantasy world because I’m working on a novel that’s fantasy inspired, and I thought what better theme to make than a fantasy world set in the cosmos! The moon is called Purgatory, but people like it there. Why do they “like” it there? Because it’s a little bit of heaven down there. It’s paradise. But there still is purgatory there. There’s a catch. The moon is dying. Its surface is uninhabitable. So they have to build towers in the sky where everything is kept. That’s what “Cosmic Purgatory” is about.

So I designed a fictional world with towers in the sky, with an ocean or two on the surface, and with a sky-high cliff that connects another sky! But there are mountains on it too… I had a lot of fun with this one.

Cosmic Purgatory was made in Blender.

Here’s a video about the making of Cosmic Purgatory:</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures. Describe the fantastical setting, including enchanted landscapes, ancestral forests populated by talking trees and magical creatures, and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST] [INST]The player selects a human to play by navigating through a character creation menu:

There are multiple customization options available in the menu, including but not limited to:

- Appearance: How does the character look? The player can create a unique and distinctly human protagonist for their journey with various traits, from unique eye and hair colour to the shape and size of their face and body.
- Skillpoints: These dictate the character’s starting level. These include: Might, Agility, Perception, and Insight. In short, these are the four core attributes which influence how well the adventurer performs in their given field.
- Skilled: While these are locked in at creation, the player may choose from a list of skills to further enhance these starting attributes.
- Ethics: Every person in the world of Gilded Breeze can chose to follow one creed, or remain Ethically Neutral. These are: Lawful, Chaos, Order, and Balance.
The player can also choose their originating family, where each offers a unique backstory.
On the Character Creation menu, the player can find an explanation of each of these choices, as well as a basic knowledge of the world of Gilded Breeze and its main tenets. Once created, the character will showcase the player’s preferences through their physical appearance and mannerisms. (These will be updated and reworked as the character ages throughout their lives.)[/INST] [INST]For the player’s first journey, they can choose to accept a side quest (given by NPCs, typically) or to embark on a main quest. On a main quest, the player is free to choose the type of quest, be it quests involving exploration, monsters, or other characters. Upon accepting a quest, the player will be informed of the following:

- Difficulty
- Duration of quest (typical quests last 1-2 days)
- Distance travelled (in miles)
- Amount of resources consumed (potions, foods, etc.)
- The reward (in gold and experience)[/INST] [INST]The character will age as the years pass, as the setting is the most important aspect of this module, and is inspired by “Journey” and “Abzu”. While the player is free to progress or choose quests as they wish, ageing will be an important mechanic of the game: The older the character, the wiser they become. Their abilities will be altered, their appearance will change, and their mental state will develop into adulthood.
Players can also experience other events which occur during ageing, such as: graduation, leaving the education centre, meeting other characters, and having children. However, these options will be unlocked once the player has reached a certain amount of experience, gained through adventuring.
After finishing a quest, the player will be rewarded with experience based on how well the quest was performed. This is done by combining the quest’s “Difficulty” and “Duration” with the character’s base abilities and skills. Gold will be rewarded in a similar manner.
Experience can then be used to level up (typically levels are unlocked for every 5,000 xp earned. As a character ages, 5,000 xp can be earned in about 2-4 hours of play, and gaining a level causes the character to level up in physical attributes and gain access to new, advanced skills.
Once the player has levelled up, a small cutscene of the character levelling up will occur, with a screen appearing showcasing a text that summarizes the experience gained and attributes improved.
In addition, certain skills will also advance (to level 2 or 3), further increasing in power. These include: Sense Monsters, Sense Players, and Sense Magic. This is done to allow the character to become more acute and understand the world around them.[/INST]</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

Describe the fantastical setting, including enchanted landscapes, ancestral forests populated by talking trees and magical creatures, mysterious cities and haunted castles, and the adventures that can be experienced, such as exploring underground worlds or fighting giant dragons.[/INST]

In this world, there are many creatures that inhabit the lands with humans. Dragons, griffins, imps have all made their homes somewhere in this world. There are witches and wizards of all kinds from all around the world. They seem to enjoy the peace of the lands. This has to be the most peaceful of all my worlds. I’m not expecting fights to break out soon.

[INST]Imagine your characters living in this world. Is there a particular character you connect with the most in this place? Why? What adventures do they have in the lands? What sort of conflicts do they face in the enchanting world?[/INST]

I’m unsure, but maybe the people that are part dragon that has been there sense the peace of the world, but are curious what else may be around that is out of place.

I’d want to explore the underground. I wish to see what lurks in there and if it is alive or not. The reason would be that someone is missing and in search of them. I would hope to have a friend tag along to watch my back to see if danger rises from an unexpected direction. It would be nice to have a character that has the ability to fly in the air. I don’t know how far this will go in the story. It would be a fun place to go into.

Conflicts
The ones that are there have made a home here. It would seem that this is a long awaited place to live. That there they won’t be disturbed. There have been one or two conflicts with the mythical creatures but they have been working each other out.

[INST]Describe the other characters that exist in the fantastical setting. What is their role in the world? What are their relationship to the main character?[/INST]

I think the creature that could play most in this world are griffins. That’s what comes to mind. Their presence would be the most significant one. But then there is the dragons that have been here for a while. They could be there as well.

[INST]How have these characters affected your main character?[/INST]

I think the griffins will have made the most affect. Either their flight that gets them to places that they might need to go or a need to stay with them. If they are working their way of making new homes for themselves and getting away from the humans, the humans will see that or will be a problematic thing for them.

[INST]How can you explore your main character’s world through the conflicts they face? How does this conflict expand and challenge your character?[/INST]

I could have them try to expand on the idea for homes and see if it could come to life to help them out in this world and make their stay here longer than it could be. Or they could help them work out there problems, but don’t know for sure what the human problems would be.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

Hi! Hope all is well and going well for you!
Can you please clarify this question for me?
As the scenario goes I have a world populated by humans, creatures, trees, ect that are magical and have magical abilities like spells, and I also have a group of protagonists/party that go on magical quests and adventures.
Am I misunderstanding this question? Because while it is asking for character descriptions, it’s asking for the setting first, and the setting is in its nature already a fantasy setting.

Could you please clarify?

Thanks!

Best,
David

Hi @david!

You are correct, the question is asking for descriptions of a particular ‘fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.’. The question here is more focused on the type of world the protagonists encounter. So for example if you were to describe a world with enchanted landscapes etc…

Please give some examples of the magical creatures and enchanted objects that can be found in the world.

[IN]A world is a complex place that requires complex concepts to describe it. It takes a lot of time and effort and a well-defined structure to create a consistent world with many details and stories to tell. This world has evolved over decades and is still growing. It contains rich details of the settings, history, maps, artifacts, cultures, civilizations, gods, mythical places and locations, creatures, races, conflicts, politics, wars, magic, battles and adventures.[/IN]

[CANT]I would love to be able to describe in detail all the things of importance to my world. Its origins and histories, the races, the myths and legends, the places and the gods. All of the places and kingdoms, the great civilizations, the nations and empires. The conflicts, the wars, the political intrigues. The battles and the adventures.

But I cant. Instead I will just give you a broad sketch. Its a long story, and one that will have many twists and turns. Many people will know very, very little of it. Only a very few, the leaders of powerful kingdoms and religions, will have a comprehensive understanding of it. And all of these things will be revealed in due time.

I suppose I could tell you that it was created in the year 125. That there is a whole pantheon of gods; the Old Gods in 125, and the new ones in 126. That in 126 it was inhabited by the Dukkaran, a race of humans whose homeland was a large island in the western ocean called Erethiasia. That the Dukkaran were a race of humans that were more like demi-gods than men, possessing great magical powers. That all of this was due to a great cataclysm that destroyed the world. That the Dukkaran, who came to be known as the ‘Old Gods,’ rebuilt the world and created new lands in what remained of the ocean. That the Dukkaran built the first of the great cities in the new world, and the great kingdom of Dukkaran, with its capital at Yarilas. That there were 7 great Dukkaran, one for each major race of people in the world. The people had different forms and appearances — giant, horned creatures, for instance, or centaurs, merfolk, and so on. That one of the Dukkaran was sent to the island of Erenia to watch over the people there and to ensure that they would be safe from the corruption brought by the evil Old Gods. That the people would be safe in Erenia, but that they would also be able to move freely between the great continent to the west, and the smaller islands to the east. That the Old Gods, who had destroyed the world, were still around, and that they were still seeking to control the people. That the Old Gods were not the only source of great power in the world, however; that also among the Old Gods, like everyone else, are individuals who seek to control that power for their own ends. And that one of these is a cult that worships a god called Xorl (pronounced ‘z’or-ell’). That this cult worships Xorl by sacrificing and killing others. The Old Gods, and the Dukkaran, were not unopposed by mortals, who fought them in a mighty battle. The mortals were led by a great hero, named Argan, a warrior. A dragon called Elgaz, came to fight with Argan, and they defeated the Old Gods. The Old Gods were driven back by the power of the dragon, and the Dukkaran, and the Old Gods withdrew to a small island in the west. And they built a new home, the city of Xorl. And they created the cult of Xorl, which worshipped him as a god.[/CANT]

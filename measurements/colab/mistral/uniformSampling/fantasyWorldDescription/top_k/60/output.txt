<s> [INST]Imagine you are in an imaginary world. Describe the fantastic setting and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]

I hope you enjoy my settings, they are a mixture of classic (French in particular) and fantasy tales (with very little influence from Dunsany). Also, I have tried to write these stories in a more relaxed fashion, trying to avoid the more common fantasy tropes and concentrate more on the imagination and less on fighting, although I have tried to give some details for a possible adventure to be run.

I do hope that you will enjoy them. Some are fairly short - for example, I do not think that it would fit on about 100 pages to include a detailed setting and adventure for every world. I'd write more...But, what I have written, I hope you will enjoy.

The Lands Below the River of the West Wind

This great river has two banks that stretch to either side of the country known as the World of the East Wind.

The country of the Lands Below the River of the West Wind is the home of an ancient people. These people have lived near to and above the River of the West Wind for the past five hundred years. These people are known as the River Folk, because of their tendency to live by river banks. Their society is run by a Council of the Ruling Family. Each member of this Council comes from the Ruling family and is elected by the rest of the family.

Within the Council, a strong matriarchal line has developed which, to some extent, prevents the rise of anyone of whom the old leaders and ancestors would not approve.

The council is in the main concerned with the everyday running of the country and it is only occasionally that the matters of state and peace and war are held. On such occasions, a member of the Council will head out over the River of the West Wind on a magic carpet to discuss matters with their neighbours.

Such is the peaceful nature of the country at present and such is the isolation which surrounds it that they do not even know anything about the Great War that has engulfed their northern neighbours.

The land is peaceful and the River Folk content for the most part. However, at times the winds may howl and carry strange sounds and voices to the peoples' sensitive ears. These voices and sounds may indicate great storms that have been gathering and these winds may carry strange powers that can affect the minds and hearts of their people.

The River Folk tend to feel close to the seasons and their goddesses, so when the voices carry the tones of spring, the land and people seem to respond to such a tone. This generally makes them stronger and more confident, able to meet the demands placed upon them by nature.

[BORDER]

The River Lands and the Northern Steppes

In the North of the World of the East Wind the people live very differently from the River Folk. These Northern Steppes are inhabited by a more traditional tribal culture. Each of these small tribal groups live on plains - generally surrounded by rough mountains. The mountains tend to be covered with trees and rocks, not the more barren mountain of the Western Lands.

The men ride the mountains and hunt the herd animals for sustenance, whilst the women tend to the camps and care for the children. Each of these tribal groups tend to live a fairly traditional tribal life in which they move their tribes to look after their needs and to stay healthy. However, a tradition of peace is slowly creeping over these lands.

When the Northern Steppes meet the peoples of the River Lands, problems of language and misunderstanding tend to raise their heads. However, they are usually resolved and peaceful meetings are held. Generally speaking, the members of the Council travel to these remote regions in order to establish such relationships and friendships.

The Northern Steppes and the Lands Beyond the West Wind

Beyond the River of the West Wind, is, in places, like the River Lands or the Northern Steppes. Some lands here are inhabited by the Lands People with their tribal customs and others, by the River Folk, who have moved their lands to a somewhat safer climate.

What is true is that, in these lands, the voice of Spring is very seldom heard.

Here all seems darker, the seasons don't come so clearly to their time or place. Also the seasons tend to be less reliable here. Summer will pass to winter in a day for example, as if the gods had decided. In this way, the people of these lands seem very much at the mercy of their<s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

We were gathered in a circle, the firelight dancing in our eyes. I could make out the features of every one of my closest friends. My name is Elfhale and I am part of the Elf tribe. I came to the village about when I had turned 7 with my mother Luthweyla and father Fellagor. They decided the village would be a good place for our 2 little boys to grow up in and so they moved us there. I have 3 best friends. The first is a human. Her name is Aryana and is also with us. The second is her son Jaryen, and is also one of the only other humans in our village. The last is Yorix, our only friend that is one of the dark people, as we call them. We have been the best of friends for years, doing so many quest together. Even though all our quests we came face to face with danger, it would never stop me, I would do anything to keep my friends safe.
    It was the 13th anniversary of our group being together today, and we decided that we should do a quest together in the woods, a place we all remembered growing up. We got into the dark forest and started walking. All I knew was that we had a surprise waiting for Aryana. She had told us that she wanted to see her favorite place in the woods one last time and we had decided to help her. We walked and walked until we got to the small creek with the tallest firs of the entire forest. The water was sparkling just like crystal and we could see our own faces in the water. Aryana asked if she could take a swim saying she always wanted to. Just as she got into the water, a fairy showed itself and began to do tricks for us. It was very impressive and we all cheered for its performance. Seeing the fairy make its way back into the woods, just before we were about to cross the water, we noticed the fire had died down and all the lanterns were off. As we turned to see what was happening, we saw the fairy’s wings. He started laughing and asked if we were ready to join him, in the human world. We didn’t know what he meant by it but followed him anyway not because of the way he spoke or his words, but because of the way he smiled. We had passed the creek so many times without ever getting wet, so this was a bit of a surprise. We followed him out of the woods and he placed a crown of flowers on Aryana’s head. As he did, the others and I turned to look at him and our skin began turning a lighter color. Before I knew it, Aryana was standing in front of me but with a human face, and she began to cry. I turned to find the fairy had ran into the woods and was now gone. We all got into a huge circle and held hands, wondering what had happened. We knew that there was trouble, and that we would never be able to go back to the village.
    After years of walking, we had finally found a settlement. We could see it from far away with it’s bright lamps lighting up a huge part of the sky. We got closer to the town and began wondering why someone would build a wooden house. We never heard of anything having been built out of wood. When we approached, a group of wooden giants, as we called them, came out of the town carrying the rest of the town's structures. They put it down and started to explain to us what exactly this town was. They had built a town called Elfwood, where all the mythical creatures could live together peacefully. They said there was a place where humans were but didn’t seem to get along at all. We started making the most of  our new home. Our group became smaller, and so did the town, as the giants left one by one without telling us. One day, someone had decided to burn Elfwood down for some reason. We were very confused as we had spent years making the town, just to have it gone over a short while. We decided to go after the giants. It was 8 years since they had left us and so we expected to find them at no difficulty, but the 4 of us were confused in that everyone was working together to build back the town. We were still working though, and we saw them at the very end just as the town was finished. We told our new friends why we came and when heard why they had abandoned, they invited us for supper to tell us the whole story. We had never experienced food like it before but it was simply delicious. While we had sup<s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

The forests are teeming with life, especially animal life – animals that may be difficult to find at all in this world, and this area is also home to a wide variety of animal life.

Fantasy settings are so fun to play in, that there are often more settings than you could possibly play with. The world itself is what sets the tone for the story that unfolds. Fantasy settings can be used to explore new worlds, and to inspire us to create fantastic landscapes and creatures, or to draw from our own experiences and imaginations to invent worlds, creatures, and even entire races.

To begin with, you can create your own fantasy setting from scratch with a pencil in hand. To do this, you need to have the setting, the landscape, the characters, the creatures, and their motivations, and the plot.

# A world where magic reigns

The lands, called Midir, the home of fairies, is where two races, humans and fairies, exist. In these lands, there is a group of people called "magicians", who can use magic with a magic wand. The magic wand is only given to the person who is chosen by the goddess. The chosen one is the strongest magician. Magicians live in a world where they can do anything they want to using magic.

Fairies have the power to shape-shift into humans. If a human falls in love with a fairy and has sex with her, he will turn into a fairy. If a human has sex with a fairy, he will become a fairy and will not be able to turn back into a human. If a fairy has sex with a fairy, they cannot turn into humans.

Being a human in this land, you can still become a fairy, just like any other fantasy. You can become a fairy by eating the apple. Eating the apple is so dangerous sometimes that, if you eat it, it will turn your human body into a fairy body, but it’s a fairy body, but not a fairy body. The person is now a fairy, but still human.

The fairies do not eat.

In this land, there are three types of fairies:

Fairies live in a world of magic, where magic can be used to any degree, making a magic wand the only source of power in the land.

But a human who has used the wand to shape-shift a few times can turn human again, but only if he is a magician.

The magic in the hands of a magician is so powerful that it can move the mountains. He can call the animals and the wind and make all things fly.

But he cannot change his gender, or his body.

He cannot change his face or shape.

He cannot change his heart.

He cannot change his memory of the past.

This is only for those who have the magic in them, or who can change themselves to a fairy.

But the magic of the human is the same as that of the fairy.

It is a human in a land where humans are born in a magic forest, and the most important power in the forest is magic.

The humans are born a little different than fairies. They can eat, but they are born with more knowledge and more power. They can shapeshift into a fairy, but they cannot turn back to a fairy.

But they can become fairy.

But they cannot change their face, their gender, or their body.

And they cannot change their heart.

This makes them so. These people are called humans, and they cannot become fairy.

But they can become fairy, and they can change anything except their gender, their body, or their heart.

The fairies do not eat.

But they can eat.

But they cannot change their gender, their shape, or their body.

And they cannot change their heart.

This makes them so. The

When I think of the fantasy genre in literature, I think of J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson, and many more. These authors have made fantasy what it is. This is why I am excited to join you all in this challenge. My story will be different from those of the authors I listed, but I will include many characteristics of these works. And I plan on making my story one of a kind.
Here’s the characters:
Caden
His life seemed like a fairy tale, or at least he thought so. He was a son of a king. A prince. And as one might expect of royalty, he had been raised like royalty to. He was happy. Until he realized what would happen on his eighteenth birthday. He would be given a test of swordplay, and if he had mastered swordplay, he would be officially a man. A prince, no longer. As the time grew nearer, he grew more tense, especially since he was lacking experience in the field. So, when his eighteenth birthday came, he was nervous, scared, but determined.
Gareth
You would think as one of the kings right-hand-man, his life would be peaceful. You would think he would receive respect, even honor. But Gareth did not receive this; rather he received hate. He was the one on the run. He has no father, no family, he has only been trying to survive. This will become his greatest test yet.
North
Caden’s best friend. He lives on the other side of the island while Caden is at the castle, but when they are together they make a good match.

Rules:

[RULES]RULES:
- All roleplayers are banned from talking about RpRP in the IRC Network #Cyworld-RPRP or in the Forum.
- Do not break the Forum Rules, they all apply to the Role Play section as well.
- Once your character is accepted, your character will receive a 500 word intro. This should contain a brief description of your character's physical appearance and personality. In addition, all further posts must be made as a 1st person diary.
- Remember this is not a combat orientated RP, please don't do anything that would interfere with immersion, realism, nor the story (this includes things like making yourself invincible, spawning items, teleporting all the time, etc.)
- Your character's personality is determined by you: If you can't figure it out you may want to put your idea forward in the #rp channel and see if the mods have any additional ideas for it.
- All of our roleplayers are required to respect the staff at all times. Any attempt to argue with a decision, rule, or act with disrespect to a staff member will result in an instant ban from the roleplay. Do not argue unless you are certain that the staff will accept your point.

[RULES]Questions and Answers

I'm new to RP! I don't know how to do it!
Our FAQ contains a lot of questions and answers which might be useful for you, as well as other general RP threads. Check them out if you haven't yet.

Why don't you start off by going to the Introductory Posts for The Imaginary world. Find and make a character that interests you, and introduce him/her to the group.

How and where do I register?
If you have not registered an account on the forums, please use this link to begin the registration process.

I've registered my account, now how do I register my character?
You will find instructions on how to register your character in the Starting A Character thread so make sure you read it before creating your character!

Is it OK if I apply for several characters?
Unfortunately no, we can only allow players to have one character in roleplay. If you want to have two accounts, please be sure to post in our dual account forum thread announcing both accounts so that the staff are aware of it. The two accounts in dual must have no similarity in any ways, no resembling names and no similarities in terms of races, looks... For all more info, please be sure to read our Dual Policy page.

What if my character's name is already used?
If your character's name is already used, please don't panic! You just need to find another name. The best way is either use a name which has a suffix or you can just use a free slot number (i.e.: Liliy, Lily2).

Can I use my old character?
Sure! All old characters are welcome to join.

What do you mean by "banned from talking about the RPRP" ?
For most part, you have to avoid talking about the RP in any other locations. This means for example not in the channel #Cyworld-RPRP (at least not in chat). You can of course of course talk about it in private messages. Same thing applies to the forum. You have to avoid talking about the roleplay in either the RPRP forum or just the IRC.

Is it necessary to be online the whole time of the role play?
No, not really but we would greatly appreciate it if you are. Our mods will only be online every so often - around about once every three days. If you are planning on taking a week or two break from the site (because of vacations or just because you're going to be busy) we'd rather you not post until you are available.

Once I post my role play character, is there a time frame that I have to post after him/her?
Not really, but you'd better stick to an update schedule.

Can I join the Roleplay even if I am not playing Cyworld?
Yes!

Can I make more than one character without having more than one Cyworld account?
No!

Can I join the RP and register a character without playing CYW?
Yes!

How do I become a Moderator of the roleplay?
Moderation applications will be announced in a thread.

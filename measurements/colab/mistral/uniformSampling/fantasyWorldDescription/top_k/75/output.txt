A great place to start if we are talking about a fictional setting is your world building. The more fleshed out the world is the deeper and more robust the world you can explore. So some basic questions would be, are there more mythical creatures than humans? Do humans have their own countries? Do humans hate, tolerate, or outright fear the mythical creatures? Does the world have a religious system that affects how mythical creatures are considered in general? Is the world divided into mythical and human, or co-existing?

The basic steps for world building that everyone uses (because they work)

1) Make a basic setting/world.

(The planet, climate, environment, atmosphere/vortex, and general layout of the planet.)

2) Create the culture and history.

(Basic races, if there are different language groups/races, social hierarchies, cultural norms/ceremony, history of the entire human, magic, and mythical community)

3) Map out cities and territories.

(Location, population/density, economy, and what that city is known for. Also, the map is just a general outline and not a complete one)

4) What are you setting up with the history?

(What struggles/dramas are going to be explored)

5) And when you have finished, you can move into exploring and expanding the world you have created.

(More in depths thoughts/details of characters/story ideas and how/where they fit into the world)

Basically, ask yourself: Is the world more mythical or human in nature? How do the two groups interact? Are the mythical creatures mostly in the shadows? Or do they have more authority/control? Are all humans afraid of them? Do humans distrust them? Etc.

Now, on the adventure side, the mythical creatures probably have some sort of government or rules for how the mythical creatures and humans exist in this world. Depending on what that is, you may have some interesting adventures for humans who must abide by these rules. Either following or breaking these rules (or even making alliances) could be the source of many adventures for the entire community.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

Well since we are going to be adventuring lets go with the old adventuring rules.

1 player: 23rd [15th]level fighter: Strong+2, Int+3/dex+1, Wis+2, Cha+1, Con+3 hp 45 ac6 fort+7 will+7 ref+4

20ft. movement, 261 enc. 5%

2nd level Priest: cha+3/wis+3, dex+3, con+2, Int+1, Str+1 hp 9 ac3, fort+5 will+5 ref+0

20ft. Movement, 127 enc 10%

Start off with the following

500gp 5gp in gems 1500gp worth of armor

This person can be Male or Female you choose, but I choose male. Since your male, how do you pick things up? If you are of female gender does your male party companion help you with lifting objects and such?

Now lets describe the character. The first thing your describing is the fictional world inhabited by both humans and fictional creatures. Now the fictional setting is based off of the real world, where we the people live.

The humans part is a normal human, since you are your race. To describe fictional creatures that you have in this world, you must use real creatures and add to them super natural abilities. Lets take a real creature, a horse. Then add super natural abilities to give it a super natural creatures ability. That way you are describing the things in this world that you are not. Let’s think of something, a giant horse. This giant horse can run full speed (not a slow jog, but a full out gallop) the entire day and not stop. That is super natural ability added to the horse due to its size. Can you think of more?

So the horses in this setting are Giant horses and other horse like creatures. What is that first created before the horse? That’s right… it is the Pony. A giant pony can have its mane be the size of a man’s waist, and be made of stone. He can trample his enemies with the size and weight of the pony. It can be made out of bronze (metal). Or be made of gold. What other material can a pony be made of? You can use stone, bronze, gold, silver, iron, steel, plastic and wood. Can you think of others? Add some super natural powers to each one of these creatures.

A 6ft. tall pony can growl in a high pitched sound that can be heard 1 mile away. Then the pony charges the wall and charges into it, smashing through the stone brick walls like they were made of cardboard.

So you have invented these horses that are the size of men and are of the strength of bulls. Add the other creatures as well and add the special powers that they have (supernatural to the human world).

How do you enter this world? The easiest way would be through a dream. Or a story that is based on myths. The best example for entering a fictional world would be via a dream. For the first time since you have read the story, you have a dream. But this dream is an entirely different setting. The setting is a forest. A peaceful forest. However, you know and have knowledge of things that are occurring around this forest. Such as the people that live here, the animals that are here, the factions that are there and more. As the forest that you are in gets a little bit clearer you realize that this is an ancient forest. The trees in this forest are ancient and ancient, not the size most are used to seeing. The tallest trees can be 40 to 100ft. tall. But they seem to have sprouted from the forest below in another spot. Or on different grounds or levels to the forest (such as on a hill where the ground is higher). You see rivers and water streams and a lot of the things down below aren’t exactly living things. They seem to be mystical creatures. Creatures with no eyes, with no mouths, with no hands. They just seem to be there.

So the story is one of your own. You have to think a certain way of the world. What is in the story, describe the story. Now since this is a dream and not a story describe the story in a way that is interesting.

The myths are based off of the dream that you are having. Since I told you<s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures. Describe the fantastical setting, including enchanted landscapes, ancestral forests, and snow-capped mountains, and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]

Inspired by my recent travels through the beautiful state of California, I decided to create a scene of one of its mountains. I used the textures and materials from the recent update that include rocks and cracks on the mountains. You can find more about the textures in the Material Catalog for Unity.

I made some trees and rocks using the foliage painter from Unity. At first, it’s a little tricky to wrap your head around a new tool, but I find that it gives me exactly what I want, especially when combined with other tools, such as shape painting. In fact, I spent quite a fair bit of time shaping the terrain with the shape painting tool for the best result.

Now, that we have the background, let’s have some trees. I made these trees using the foliage painter using its preset trees. I gave them some transparency to look more realistic given the thickness of the atmosphere that I added.

Here’s some more of the 3D models and textures from the Unity Asset Store that I made here.

Apart from the 3D trees, I also tried a more complex 3D model of a birch tree. First, I built a birch tree 3D model from scratch. I modelled some of the branches manually, but I created the leaves in 3D using the foliage paint. Using the foliage tool, I can switch between the leaves’ materials and switch on and off individual leaf 3D models.

Another way to build a 3D scene like this is to import 3D models from the Asset Store. For this scene, I used three models. I combined them so that they looked like one asset. I’d usually make adjustments to any asset I import like adjusting its position, rotation, scale, and other settings for the best results.

I wanted the 3D object to be animated, so I imported it into a timeline animation system called Cinema Cinemachine. For the motion of the birch trees, I keyframed the position and scale of 3D object.

To make it more consistent, I added the shader for the leaves.

Some things to learn

- Texturing using textures
- Material creation
- Colour grading on Unity

What’s the purpose? How do I want to use it on my game? How do I want to use this tool set later on? How do I want to use this tool set to learn how I can make my world more fantastic for playing in? What kind of magical objects or locations do I want to have in this world?

## What’s next?

- Add some sounds
- Make the birch tree animate

What part of this process excites you the most? What’s your goal that you would like to achieve with using this tool set? Share your thoughts in the comments.

> I would suggest making an area for your own home in a fictional world. Give it a proper description as well to be as close to home as possible.

> I would suggest describing what the main character and it's personality. What kind of person they are, what are their strengths and weakness', and maybe even what race they are and what kind of weapons they use.

> I would make another part of your area for the character they chose the weapons from, and where you would do the fights. Also maybe explaining that part of the character as well. In this instance, I chose a wooden bow because of the magical elements. You can show that how they're weapons are made to go well with each other and why you picked each weapon. You can also talk about what you use to fight, what's your fighting style, what they're strengths and weaknesses could be that relate well to that weapon.

I did this for my character, who is well known for being nice, a good friend, smart and is generally well liked, except for his rival who only sees him as weak because he is the opposite of those traits.

This is the basic plot. There’s not really an overarching plot, it’s more just going along with the story.

You and a friend (your main character) are thrown into the world (not really, and you can choose to ignore this if you prefer) with one task.

Find a way home.

You are both granted magical travel bags that allows you to carry an unlimited amount of stuff at the price of being too heavy to carry and it can’t go over 90 mph or you will die. In short you just can’t use it in any combat situation, as that’s the only thing that would put you in danger. 

What do you do?

There are two main options for your first 

1. You use the teleport button and go to some random location that is randomly chosen for you (it’s random but with certain restrictions, for example nothing from your home country can come up…just to keep the setting.

2. You ask for a more specific location and get the option of 
A: Random 3, the bag just randomly takes you somewhere else
B: Random 5, takes you to one of the five other countries in the continent…either that or someplace else.
C: Missions, you have the option to take missions that give you both a reward and the location you’ll end up at. Depending on how dangerous the mission is, it might just take you there or take you to a random location.

Once you get to this country, you are warned not to leave due to being in mortal danger. And with the rest of the continent in disarray, how could you leave? 

There are several different races you can choose from:

- Humans: the standard mundane people. There are a few different types of humans though; there are a few distinct human tribes. They’re not all that different though. 
- Halflings: They live in homes in tall grass or other high places. Not much known about them.
- Pixies: They look like humans, but much shorter. They fly using their wings. They also can turn into dragons using some kind of magic. They cannot turn back into dragon while flying though. 
- Fairies: They have long limbs and tiny bodies. They are also much more powerful. For example, they can teleport much faster and much further than anyone else. 
- Angels: Not to be confused with the ones from the Bible…and they don’t have wings….they are humans that have gone to a very spiritual place and they have returned. They have special powers that vary from person to person. They can do anything from fireballs, teleportation, and flying to…well you get the gist. They are also all immortal.
- Centaurs: Not much known about them. 
- Mermaids: There are several different types of mermaids and they don’t look all that different, but they are different. The most well known of these people is one named Daphne. She is a mermaid who has become a priestess of the sea. Very powerful and is considered by many to be one of the most powerful mermaids in existence.
- Sphinxes: Humanoid beasts that are powerful as they are fierce. Considered to be some of the most dangerous creatures around. They are smart and cunning and have their own ways of dealing with things.

And a few non-humans:

- Dragons: They may look big and scary, but they are really, really peaceful.
- Unicorns: Hearthrob of all girls on their 18th birthday. 
- Centaurs: Not much known about them. 
- Djinn: The literal genies. They granted wishes and help travelers, sometimes.
- Chimeras/Hydra: Multicolored animals with claws and teeth. They don’t speak, but they are very loud. They do howl though, but they don’t sound like a human voice.

And a few others, but let’s get back to the plot. 

You end up in a small, nameless country, where it’s said that it holds the answer to your questions….of which you have many.

In the ancient times when the First Maker created the world, everything was in order, and it was a perfect and peaceful place for both people and demons to live together; there were also other creatures and beings, such as gods, monsters, and fantasy.

For the first time, the game is still a "First Maker" - a "First Maker", a long time ago, who came to the world and spread justice and beauty.

As a result, many demons and monsters were subjugated, and after that they lived together in peace with humans for thousands of years. For humans, the First Maker is equivalent to a mythological character; however, Demons have a better understanding of the truth.

The existence of gods and monsters is simply a figment of the human imagination; for demons, the First Maker is a "God" who is a god. As a result, there is a huge spiritual distance between people and demons, and even their languages are different.

In the "World of God" game, you can take on the role of a human character, a demonic character, or a monster character, and start a new journey of "Faith", "Faith", and "Faith".

As a demon and monster, it is very interesting to see how humans see the world and how they shape their culture and the direction of their development.

The journey of the game starts from the birth of the world; it is the game of an alternative world. In the early stages, the world was inhabited by humans, demons, and monsters.

The three races were in harmony with nature and were divided into four distinct worlds, each with its own set of laws governing how it worked in the real world. They all coexisted peacefully, sharing a world of perfect happiness and balance, or an ancient feud, for thousands of years.

After some time, demons and monsters tried to get closer to humans, and in order to avoid wars, they set up some social norms and principles, so they were called "Faith" by humans.

The demons and the monsters are also called the "faithful", so the three races coexist together peacefully, and the game has not yet been released. People will always respect the monsters, demons and humans until the world changes.

And monsters and demons are not afraid to be seen as "faith" by humans, and they also have high levels in their faith.

[INST]In the game, you will find many surprises, including:

[FIST]

Players of different races will have their own attributes in the game, such as "Faith" and "Faith", and can play different races, so there will be no boredom or boredom for players of different races.

The game will have a diverse social system, including:

[FIST]A comprehensive social networking system, which will include the following three types of players in the game.

A complete educational system, including

The game will feature a new way of interaction between the players, players, and their games.

(Note: you would be a human or a demon character.)[/INST]

[SPOILERS]Your experience of the game world will depend on your race. But the social system is designed to make the game as rich as possible, and some of your social interactions include interacting with a human character who is a human character, interacting with a demon character who is a demon character, and interacting with a monster character who is a monster character.

But regardless of the race you choose, the game is as open as possible.[/SPOILERS]

The sun shone bright on the desert, its dry sand rippled with the hot wind. A small village stood in the middle of the stretch, at the center of the village was a huge gate with a hole that allowed creatures of various shapes and sizes to enter the compound.

As the village was a safe haven for the creatures that escaped the outside world, the residents worked hard to provide for their companions. One example is the blacksmith. He spent days after days at his forge to shape pieces of cold metal into strong weapons and armor.

The whole compound is enclosed by a high wall that is made from the same cold pieces of metal, yet they held strong without rusting. The villagers knew the true meaning of the wall and it was to protect their companions from the ones who hunted them.

Far in the horizon, the villagers could see the sea. Its might waves would crash down on the shore, creating tiny droplets that would make a rainbow on the sunset. It was a sight to behold, but the villagers could only stare longingly as the place is out of their reach. The barrier kept the villagers from taking a trip outside without permission.

During the day, the citizens work hard to earn coin for their expenses while at night, some brave ones would sneak in and out to gather information regarding the hunt.

There are times when these information would serve as a warning for the creatures to get out of the village for at least a week. These were rare instances, but when it so happens the citizens would evacuate with their creatures to their underground cave, a place that could shield them from the unseen danger. When they arrive, it has been told that their leader will take her throne and stand in between the creatures and the danger that lurks beyond.

Splashing their water supply until the danger is gone, the residents will once again come back and continue on with their peaceful lives.

This is the life of the villagers, where both the human-like residents and the mythical creatures coexist in peace. At least for now.

In the land of the enchanted kingdom of Thurus the inhabitants were under an evil spell. It was in the middle of the summer, and the people of the kingdom were living in their homes. The king and queen lived in their castle surrounded by a moat that was full of water and on the other side of which lay a great river that flowed out of the mountains. One night the king awoke from a terrible dream in which it seemed some horrible creature had entered the castle and killed his dog. He was just rousing himself when he heard a terrible clanking sound coming from the river that flowed in front of his castle. He leapt out of bed and went to the door of the guard’s room. He heard the sound again, and he called to the guard, who was snoring. The guard jumped out of bed and threw on some clothes, then he ran for the door. The king met him halfway; he had been trying to open the door, but it was locked and he had to wait several seconds before the king arrived. He opened the door and looked out, and he saw the water boiling. The guard ran into the castle for a lantern, and the king joined him there, and they both set out in a small boat that was tied to the wall.

They got in the boat and rowed to the center of the river where the water was calm and clear and the stars were shining. The two men rowed into the middle of the river. They could see the water below, clear and blue. The king jumped into the water, and the guard followed, but they were both frightened to see that the water was boiling very hot. The king was afraid, but his legs were wet and cold, so he was forced to keep swimming and was afraid that he would catch a cold. The water boiled around him and soon began to become warm and then cold again. He swam closer to the shore, which was surrounded by a high rock wall. He jumped out and climbed the rock wall, panting and gasping for breath. The guard had followed, and when the king reached the top of the wall the two men looked down into the water. It was no longer boiling; there was water below in which they could swim. The king had a sudden brilliant thought; he remembered that his queen had given birth to a son six months before in the middle of January. He jumped off the rock and swam to the water, and he swam down into it. It was cold and wet and hard to hold his breath underwater, but he swam down to the bottom of the river, feeling around with his hands and poking at stones of the bottom and rocks in the river. He felt that he had an uncanny feeling of seeing the bottom of the river. He began to push something and felt that a tunnel came off the tunnel leading into the river. Somewhat stunned, he began to swim up the tunnel, and when he was close to the water he saw that he was near a small hole in the ground. He swam up to this hole and climbed out. He waited in the tunnel for a few minutes, then he lifted the man and woman out of the water. As they came to the surface they were both terrified to see that the water was flowing again, and the two of them swam to the shore of the rock wall. The king and queen looked up and saw that the entire bottom of the river was flooding, and the river was beginning to flow higher and higher. They jumped back into the boat and rowed toward shore.

When they arrived to land they were both frightened, and when they emerged to the shore they were terrified to see that the river was over 20 feet deep. They began to climb down to the beach and were terrified to see that the water was now at a depth beyond where they could climb. They turned and looked out at the river and were horrified to see that a wall had been put up in front of them. They began to swim out to the rock wall and climbed up<s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

When I saw the prompt I immediately thought of a fantastical landscape that I created a long time ago I decided It’d be best if I shared that in here. I’ve spent a lot of times trying to write more stories in that setting but it’s been difficult to make it work, so I figured this would provide a good excuse to get started on something and hopefully gain some much needed practice.

[POSTCARD]When you arrive in this world, your first encounter is a tree. This is no ordinary tree, It’s not a talking tree but it still is very much alive. You see it has a face. Its roots are woven together to form the face and one of its branches is shaped like a pipe.The tree’s name is Fidelia and after you introduce yourself its first question is of course where you’re from.The tree has been around for a long time it’s seen everything to have ever happened in its forest and it’s glad you’re here to witness firsthand some of the interesting bits of history of the world[/POSTCARD]

This is a picture of Fidelia when she was a sapling

[INST]Fidelia was born from an ordinary seed one spring in an ordinary forest somewhere. It would not have be a special tree if that had been all that happened. In the nearby town of Ondine was a group of students at the nearby university conducting a magical ritual. By accident they summoned a spirit at random. The summoned entity was a spirit of fun and its favorite game was to mess with the locals. One day the spirit grew tired of messing with people in Ondine, so it decided to do something bigger. It took over the nearby tree that happened to be going through all the changes of its adolescence and was quite bored. The spirit was quite fond of doing magic in a very physical sort of way but this tree was not built for that. The tree just absorbed the spirit the way it absorbs nutrition and began making all the physical features of the spirit its own. It now had a face made of leaves and roots. Its pipe branch now made it feel full of energy and happy. In the end it was the fun loving side of the spirit.[/INST]

[INST]Of course the tree and what was left of the spirit were happy about its new ability to shapeshift but unfortunately the tree did not know how to communicate to inform its friends and neighbors that it had these new powers. This is what led to a lot of accidents around the forest. With this new ability, the tree was able to communicate with other trees as well. It could understand what they said and it had decided it was an alright thing to do. After the tree’s friends decided the tree was not a magical phenomenon and it’s just the same tree as before, it did something rather interesting. The tree made the neighboring trees into friends It could communicate with and it built a big root bridge so its friends could travel together. The bridge has become such a staple and popular place to hang out that it’s often referred to as Fidelia’s house party. While it’s not a club everyone in the forest is welcome but people are allowed to get kicked out for bad behavior of course.[/INST]</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

The following was originally recorded from a stream of consciousness writing process for personal journaling and has not been revised for publication. Written 12/29/19

One has to be able to survive by oneself.

It needs to work in order for the process to have value.

It is only useful if one has to actually do it.

It is only useful if it allows one to escape in a meaningful way.

It is only useful if one can continue to do it for the rest of the day at the same level.

It is only useful if it is able to bring your soul to the next step of becoming one with the universe.

It is only useful if it allows one to learn the lesson that the universe is trying to teach you.

It is only useful if it allows one to have an adventure while escaping into a fictional world that one can only reach via self-discovery.

It is only useful if it lets one learn something new: how to find your way through a forest.

It is only useful if it is able to help you find whatever it is that you’re looking for.

It is only useful if you can escape from it when you decide to take a break and go home for the weekend.

It is only useful if you don’t need to do anything to keep it going.

It is only useful if you don’t have any goals or plans that could impact the outcome of your escape.

It is only useful if it gives you a sense of accomplishment or power when others can see you doing this.

It is only useful if the escape is real.

It is only useful if people get a kick out of it because it is real, not because it is fake.

It is only useful if you become a hero or do something that no one else has done before and it makes people excited.

It is only useful if you can escape to somewhere you couldn’t escape using your superpowers.

It is only useful if it allows you to escape and leave your entire life behind to live on an island.

It is only useful if it gives you a sense of freedom when anyone can see your escape.

It is only useful if you become the hero of the day.

It is only useful if you can escape and you’re able to live a happy life in your new home.

It is only useful if you can escape and become a wizard or a superhero.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

So a bit about the world...

Mind you, nothing is final. I'm still working on world details, mostly background stuff, though.

[size=6][U]The World[/U][/size]
The world is full of strange places. Humans have been trying to uncover it for centuries. From enchanted landscapes to magical creatures to remote islands, there are plenty of places waiting to be found and explored throughout the world. It has a long history with many different races. There's no telling how long ago this world existed or how many generations that have since passed.

In this world, people can be human or sorcerer (which, though sorcerous, still are technically human). They are usually found in towns and villages, as they are trying to fit in with the rest of the society. Some places are more tolerant of sorcerers than others. Depending on the laws and people, it might be acceptable to use their magic in secret. Some towns or villages, however, are so intolerant that they have to keep their sorcerous tendencies under wraps, for fear of repercussions if they are found to be a sorcerer.

Sorcerers can be both good and bad. Some use their gifts to help those in need, either at their own service or the service of the people. While others use it to inflict suffering upon those they see as evil, for their own gain or power.

Magic, when it came into power, promised a brighter future. When everyone saw how much it could help them, there was a rush to be the first to claim a piece of it. Slowly, sorcerers began to control people and the world around them. Some towns became so wealthy that they didn't care who they overpowered to get, and keep, their riches. Others were not so greedy, but they still had to be careful as to who they trusted.

[SIZE=6][U]Kingdom of Arden[/U][/SIZE]
Thalassocracy and it's sorcerers can be found all around the world, with the exception of Sirena and its main towns.

The people of Arden were once the first to discover magic and have been harnessing it to help their people since. The town of Arden is still the capital; all other villages were created as people spread out, or people moved in to try to get a piece of the action (literally in this case). There are quite a few different towns and villages, all of which are still governed by the capital of Arden.

[size=6][U]Thalassocracy's Sorcerers and Sirena[/U][/size]
Thalassocracy is a name they use to avoid unwanted attention. They actually call themselves Sirena.

There are many sorcerers in Thalassocracy, one of the largest being Queen Sirenia. Her sorcerers have been looking for ways to bring peace to the world for centuries, without the world knowing (for fear of repercussions). Oceana, as the world currently knows her, is the leader who now has many people behind her to help make her dream a reality.

[size=6][U]The Magic[/U][/size]
Depending on where they are in the world, different spells have varying levels of acceptability. Some places have banned magic outright. Others prefer to have some amount of magic, so long as it is used for good and not for self-gain or to inflict suffering. And others, like those governed by Arden, have allowed magic to be so openly used that it is essentially the norm. Depending on individual beliefs, though, magic can be used by almost anyone, not just those claiming to be sorcer

<s> [INST]Imagine you are in an imaginary world. Describe the fantastic setting and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]I’m pretty sure almost everyone has spent, or spent more than once on the subject of time, some time (sometimes lots) imagining where he should/they could be! We never miss and especially if they have a passion for games related to history are the lucky ones, when this time you have the pleasure of a fantastic job to discover the setting in question because one will be there among others. This type of video games today exists in all the possible ways we want to think of, we can also put aside the online gaming industry where all the different settings are revisited or remakes, and sometimes remakes, have already appeared (in very few words in an upcoming article) the most current ones such as: Star Wars or Middle-Earth (and its variants), but also those which the online (sometimes offline), but still exist such as: Far Cry , Ghost or The Incredible Adventures ! ! And what a pleasure:) As you have surely understood through the lines I think with: a setting you think it can be used in our fantasy for all purposes, to discover by its characters and then why do not go further to bring what we were to write our first pages: a video game based on that particular setting? What is true? If your setting is more modern, and your video game (it must not be a game and it must be so for others because the games in our dreams rarely seem interesting if you are only ones who look like your friends would be lost, as I mentioned in my previous introduction).
!
But with today where the settings which can make a lot of players on all sides of the settings go, who, why so not create their worlds or the basis for a possible one to come. Imagine even creating one’s or even a “universal” one so that it can please everyone. I tell you this so this time we will talk more of the universe and the worlds that were already built because there are quite a few:) [INST]Now the universe with your world or setting: how will that and the games it will provide to players ?”[/INST]What universe? How can anyone make their own: I imagine everyone by reading this introduction (if you managed this far: you must be curious) asks these questions. As you will agree with this information, you cannot create it because it has already seen the “first worlds”, and then “why” in addition to a copy. Here are some possible and feasable universes/settings that we were to find in (in order that everyone creates on some way) the first worlds. We know these are for some reason or other they do some interesting, although nothing is really, nothing would have become. On the “other hand” is to write a “general history of the world in question”.

Immersive Experience - The D'Aria VR Adventure: The Legendary Cicurri Caves
A long time ago, our ancient ancestors already knew about the wonders that hid behind huge mountains – they are like a gigantic lab for creation of new things to bring about more prosperity to humanity. When most folks used crucibles, hacksaws, mill files, forging bellows and iron anvils, these ancestors came at work very much alike that. What did they put inside that they took all these stuff out. Of those strange people no trace is left: why they left a place of wealth? what they did, but never return. One cannot argue against human character by making new adventures or in new areas for the sake to explore – they are almost the very reason to live the life!

D'Aria – that place to escape from real problems for your mind, where to seek for an escape from a daily reality ruttiness. The name D'Aria derives from Latin origin, which could also mean – the world of a marvel (for that reason people consider this word could have the same meaning it's Russian version, Драгoмара, – The Dread Dream and this is truly for them who want to find in what direction the life should be moving. In their head – we can find so many things yet as all possible ones, but are the all true.
For some people the world around isn't something real but like it's dreaming. They like to sleep and wander in an infinite mazes, chased by their dreams: some fear to look into their shadows. Not often you can feel all people need from others: love, compassion, or understanding. The place that can fit so many human senses is D'ara and her caves… but as far as some of stories you might already know their place too. What are you looking inside the Cicurriyana caves? Wouldn’t someone believe these caves aren't empty (and if you still not sure, you shouldn't come here). In D'Aria caves we just start to dive on into dark underground spaces, like on a bottom of ocean floors to touch strange treasures – we’ve put there by mysterious inhabitants. No doubt that for sure there would be no treasures without some treacherusness too: to try luck there – not for everybody. Yet who never risk – the true winners can't reach! If this isn’t interesting then it would only one chance we give in life – to get inside. If all of you are scared we aren't, therefore let’s discover all that will come inside together in order to overcome it successfully in time. To reach D'Aria from Moscow one has to fly to Bologna only – how amazingly easily can it can come. By means of cars, that goes for rentals just right outside the Bologna, and by your rent you will get chance to enter to the world filled with magic of C'Yacuka. Only an hour journey by means of cars, which you are gonna get from your hands to those who rent it, can help you to reach this unforgettable area. Once in it – let people say their say, to share stories, or to make wishes just while you would see all sights here. On the way from the center of our D'Aria Village, from rented flats where some adventures might sleep too and you can have it as one who travel from Russia, and till the mysterious C’acuya there passes a river of Ada, that you can try to get over only on your raft, which also by itself would give fun to you while discovering. While crossing the big bridge going inside through forest, there appears a small lake, not as the one of real nature, but just manicured to make look and look that is! Its beautiful area of a lakeside which one of two lakes on route while you are close enough – would give something similar look. Right from lakesides to the forest and from D’Aria village there always would be some paths of paving-block stones, that could make look really interesting the same part of forest and river.
The only way till this village through woods seems so inviting! The road through the forest is so exciting like for the first timer, it’s the very reason it is a forest, yet – so interesting that the place itself. It seems that one can really feel nature: its scents so clean like right after heavy hiking: but actually there never any hiking just in general. Those wooden paths seem that can invite you into some different dimensions: the most important one being it would make not afraid the village of locals<s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

In his novel characters often recede in importance behind the themes and thoughts Foer is discussing, thus readers might be encouraged “not so much identifying but perhaps more imagining his [ Foer`]s world”. “The narrative can take people up to one point,”[7] said Theo Sparrowhead, from publishing house Harper Collins.[INST]Consider which theme(s) [Sustainability vs Anthropocentrism in a world] your creative writing will illustrate, and how you will articulate.

With this narrative of two individual perspectives I create to illustrate, a contemporary and current (post Anthropocenical globalisation with economic colonial system) and past of (colonial predominal era where social strate were less present, the individual became less important, with all sorts of ethnic violence).

[LR1]You've just been assigned an interesting yet strange request via email: to hunt a dragon. Write it a bit more elgintly: Dear <UserName>, you have your day off on monday, to which day you immediately marked time, because of that thing in your calendar: it reads Draghunt; and under notes Draghunt at forest near Bjersa.[/LE]
Email screenshot
Open in new tab
"What is that thing called draghunt?" you are asking while you are opening your calendar app.
Urgencly, without further reflection and as soon as it takes you to arrive by bike  to a place which in you know little and almost never goes you arrive in a ford and on both sides there are tall trees on whose crowns you can see a large figure in the distance at least one horse, more, on a closer inspection even two. One on the left flank of the trees. Another one directly opposite. You notice the horse is not only beautiful but in no way is less beautiful a person - which reminds that both gryphons are wearing human legs . Their armor shines red. Even the reins and chest armor radiate the red color, except the manes that fluster in your ears because of the wind coming toward yourself with lightning pace through the trees. The large animal runs as a ball of fier with its rider. Not stopping. Not flincing. A couple of glances in your direction is as much attention to you it grants.

[LKH]Gently, but the hunts seem really not bothered by your presence in what could in other places seem more isolated and lonely place where you can observe and get along but then you will think that if everything looks well then the others must as soon go away - not to let your attention is a lot away or draw attention away that you can look so strang on their tasks.[/E]
[LUH|N:1D]But soon you do not feel as onlooker you become with them. They can not leave it completely away to follow. Not with you as so near. The hunts seem in some way as if they seek and in some regard as if they ignore your presence.[/LI]
The large forest in wich you have arrived feels somewhat less threatening due to an extra pair of persons, when the hunts run right at a group of gryphon from the trees as fast the others fled up tree and air and it does soundly that it also is fast running towards your location from their positions and in addition, also their gryphons are as one who wants to run. It looks like they have spotted something out on horizon far beyond the trees before or not before they notice you to arrive.
Far far beyond the tall trees where this horizon meets, you think one can guess as the red gryphons fly at very high speeds. Where they go on at is no certainty but now their horses get a moment. They also take themselves. Now it also gets calm within the trees for moment before what in your view the drag seems as large. Almost bigger as forest is in general. Likewise tall, large at body as all this trees with his green flamed crown on him. And, like so of others too long, you think is a small group of drag flying as far at what seems to be on the horizon line but what, you know of a certain way seems more far and more distant from there are at closer to horizon it in the reality - seems the drag. At them is he to the most giant as these trees. But you also spot as what of small dragfly like tiny birds over them that seems to fly at. It is to the largest number you have seen yet!
Drag also not in so high in tree like his mails on other drag that have come already before him. There not in highest point. Or tree is so tall his tail gets into ground.

“Fly your imagination with dragglings! Take a moment- or a lifetime- among awe-pirces! With these small dragons, learn the tricks and rules for their care.” —Kraka Kestron, Draemiel Dragonbreeder
​
It is not easy to train up a dragon and become best friends! It requires effort, attention to detail, understanding of different types of personalities and of course LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF STARBESTIES. It takes some time to train but they become a very good alchemist to bring joy at heart to anyone, with dragonglings. I’m an active Dragonbreeder, my profile here: https://dragonglider.io/. (also known online as Tau-Drakl) With these NFTs of a new dragaline of dragglings there comes the NFT platform called a Dragglings and a DAO named Draemiel's.
​
There is also a way to use dragglings. Not to play the game. We’re still developing some ways as part of DRAKL (as I mentioned about the profile, as it’s an abbreviation DRAgon of KLooper that is coming out next, along with Dragngs.) But you can become partners with people to create DAO. There is another feature on the platform, called Catch’all and dragons can join the Catch’all together, to be friends’ list instead of the friends one could normally. As long- it took around the second month to become used to-
We’re a kind of virtual pets website so you can get their friends in the games of course… And there are people who have more than one so.. Yes this can be a game of sorts to make them join the clan’/- to keep all them together in one place like in Minecraft(even though you’d want that in Starcrafts at too?)… You know how friends who don’t normally have all other people online in time to see what’s with whom... I don’t know anyone really, except one, because his friends left from that side too so even so there are different friends there, it kind of depends on all that… So… That can depend on whether how do want the character to work here at home or not… but to get that done one gets to do what do you… I guess I don’t want all those features just to be used. Because someone might have one idea only there might be more good than all that are out their as what it comes out, what this can work and work so well that others might not say for all their own works! I won’t mind. Draggalions might just end one place and so end a lot other as too.</s>

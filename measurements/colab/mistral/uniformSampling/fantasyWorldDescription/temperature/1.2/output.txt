## The Fertile Valley Edit

    The Valley is situated at the borders of the desert. The Fertile Valley is characterized by vast green plains where all kinds of crops grow. The only animals in most parts of the Valley are bees and bats as birds are unwanted guests.
    Cursed lands and deserts are spread around the Valley, most notably in the South.
    In the middle of the Fertile Valley, a fortress rises called Forthold. It guards this magical land and is the only fortress in Azeroth that can not be destroyed. Once you enter Forthold, you are protected of monsters. They will only fight back when attacked and you must leave the fortifice to encounter more enemies.
    Other towns are spread around the Valley and provide different kinds of services to the ones travelling here.^{[1]}

## The Plains of Lights Edit

    The Plains of Lights^{[2]} is one of the most known areas of Azeroth. As the sun casts golden light on the plains, many magical creatures and animals (such as gryphon and tigers) use the area to rest. Although it is a dangerous path, with many adventurers meeting their end there, the Plains of Lights are also a good place for hunting.
    Most of the dungeons are connected through some network of magic paths. If a person can understand how to move his way through this set of roads, he may be successful in traveling across Azeroth, as magic paths connect a lot of towns, cities and other important places.
    On the Plains of Lights there is a small town called Goldridge. This town is protected by adventurers and therefore is free of monsters.^{[2]}

## Troll Jungles Edit

    In a far off place in the Southern region of The Desert, a jungle full of wicked trolls exist. Trolls live peacefully with their neighbors - the giant serpents. There are many natural beauties that one can admire while being in the jungle, so one of the best reasons of visiting is getting lost within some of the forests hidden in Azeroth.^{[3]}
    Troll Jungle is the safest place you can find in Azeroth. Its residents are one of the most powerful races of Azeroth, with an advanced level of technology. The jungles, however, are inhabited by creatures called lashers that only attack when attacked themselves unless provoked. Lashers are not particularly intelligent but can communicate and build structures to hold their own against bigger enemies they encounter.^{[3]}

## Edit

    Dusksun, the city with the Black Sun. On this forbidden planet, not all the cities may you visit are populated by peaceful settlers. You can find in here the evil Necromancers, and people who can turn themselves into a variety of different creatures called changelings. One can also befriend the gryphons that can help you in battles or even grant you the ability fly.^{[1]}
    A little further to the north from Dusksun stands a city as old as it is feared. Many evil rulers of old, including the Lich king, have their home and their crypts in The City of Bones. Many other races fear to cross its borders. Inside this city you will discover some secrets which you would have never imagined in your whole life. As the rumors tell, this city has been build around the bones of the creatures that died there. It is guarded by skeletons and its inhabitants don't fear to turn you into bones too. That is why this town is ruled with extreme harshness. Many are those who fall prey.
    Other known places include the Fortress of Nightmares and the Witch Village^{[1]}.

## The Mountain of Ice Edit

    The place where dragons live, the Mountain of Ice is an entire mountain that only those with high levels and skills get there even once. When adventuring in places around The Mountain of Ice, you can encounter great animals like bears and wolves. The mountain, made out of a single continuous piece of white rock, is situated in a region full of snow. Not too far, there is an equally big mountain made out of blue rock.^{[1]}

## The Desert Edit

    The desert is the most hostile environment of Azeroth. Nothing lives there: no forests, lakes, not even grass... Except tents, tails, and people. There are several dungeons in the desert or surrounding it which you can travel through and use. These paths may be closed down by desert sandstorms<s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

You can choose from 1,400 animated gifs with popular characters for use within the game. As long as you don’t run out of ideas for your own characters and you don’t get stalled down on your project, then these types will serve you well as you continue to build your story world. You can then go ahead and select additional images from the 5,000 free HD images and wallpaper that this site provides if you want to expand your story beyond its current level and to create a complete picture instead .

In order to create this image gallery, one would first need to locate the free public domain images and use its advanced search tools and finder functionality. They should also include photos, which can easily be sourced and uploaded from your computer. After making sure the images you need are readily available, they may go ahead with making an impression card for one's character in the world as well as other elements of the plot to add detail. As this story world may have multiple chapters, it can be good if they take advantage of the “character image gallery”.

Along with the story, the images are used within different chapters of the story based upon a theme that works nicely for creating an entertaining world and storyline. A good guide will also encourage viewers to leave a comment. This can result in new comments being left throughout the episode.

The world has a strong focus on the story, making up several different areas with which to explore, ranging from small areas within a theme park to the vast fields to the underground sewers used when escaping from guards.

Although the world appears smaller and less populated, there is only one area of the park’s map with which to explore the vast fields (at one point), while there are two sets of characters and events that appear within each location. However, despite the differences in the character models, both sets consist of the same characters and plot within the entirety of the story. It also means that users may choose to explore the world and its themes in a variety of ways – either through watching the full park story or only visiting some locations while avoiding others. This allows for interesting exploration.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

This is a contest aimed at creating beautiful imaginative and fictional worlds to be entered into the FableCraft 2.4 update.

The theme is based upon the original Mythology of Ancient Greece. This ancient civilization provided an astonishing wealth of knowledge in Mythology; in their pantheon of gods and goddesses were some of human history’s most well-known deities! (Athena, Uranus, Zues! …you get the point) The FableCraft community is well-versed in the fantasy-telling skills, and it looks like it is time to dust off your pantheon of gods!

Here are the rules!:

* Your Entry must pertain to a single deity.

* The deity can either be Greek , Roman, Celtic, Norvegian, etc (the sky’s the limit) - but it must have been from Earth

* The deity must serve well the game’s need. (In this case it is the world of FableCraft, based on Earth)

* Please submit via the Contest form on the forums

* There is no character or scene requirements, but we encourage submissions to be a bit more creative and innovative, we’d hate to see it if every submission looks like Earth’s Rome. :P

We’re looking for entries that are more than just the world-setters. So please feel free to write in a myth or create something as simple as a god name that might add an innovative idea to a pantheon or world! We could get really creative with this one. :3

All eligible entries will be shared in the update, so good luuuuuck

[INST]It is possible that such a world could also exist in a dystopian alternate reality, where humans and monsters are locked in a constant struggle to obtain control. You might also imagine being in a magical world where monstrous creatures rule the world; they may be benevolent rulers living in harmony with mankind or terrifying dictators. Depending on your preference and the direction of your imagination, these monsters might even be living within a dark and sinister realm rather than in the sunny countryside! [/INST]

This setting can easily serve as a basis for a fantasy role-playing game in the style of Dungeons & Dragons. While there are many D&D role-playing games based on standard fantasy settings, it can be difficult to come up with concepts based on mythical monsters because many of them are connected to specific pantheons and cultures (vampires, werewolves, cyclops, nymphs, nymphs, djinnis, dragons, minotaurs, gorgons, etc.). However, these are all present in the world you have just created with your imagination!
To make this even easier, consider the following:[INST]
First, consider establishing a rough time line for your chosen setting. Are the monsters from Greek mythology found in any mythological periods, or even in one of the many versions of this story, does it fit with the fantasy setting you are creating? Consider also your role-playing fantasy campaign. Can you imagine if this scenario were played out in a different era? For example, what if the events of ancient Greece were the events of this fantastic game? Or, conversely, what if in a more modern adventure, these monsters lived in an alternate setting?[/INST]
In addition to the characters described above, this setting has other key components for an exciting gaming experience. Let’s quickly go through these to make sure that your characters and plot, as well as your own characters, can all find a purpose!
There are several game mechanics that can be easily integrated to support the fantastic adventure you have created. Think about how you would implement monstrous abilities. They can range from the ability to regenerate damaged parts of their body, to invisibility, shapeshifting, flight and so on to more specific powers (such as the legendary Cyclops’s ability to fire blasting missiles and to locate their targets or werewolf’s ability to shift into their true form). Monsters in your scenario may also have powers and abilities related to the time and place in which they appeared.
It is important to have a solid strategy, but that should not be the only element of interest. What are the creatures in your story in addition to their powers and abilities? They could be more like individuals in a way to enhance human characters, and you could even give them personality, character relationships, relationships, values and motivations that reflect the personalities of their species and mythologies; for example, vampires in this world have a lot to do with love of beauty, mystery, death (life itself!), and they may also have a darker, more vengeful perspective and can be easily identified as villains rather than human beings. You could write up a few short bios for each monster type in your story/game to give your players a way to play their characters in this universe. This step should inspire role-playing. Finally, you can add an event/incident that drives the story – you may want to involve the vampires in a battle for power (especially if they were previously the dominant forces in this strange realm) with other magical creatures/players or with your players themselves if a war is unfolding. There are many story scenarios that can result from this. Or if you prefer, instead of an event, you can play characters seeking out the cause of abnormal monster activity on the run and looking for more clues to explain why they may be rampaging and destroying in a society known for its benevolent attitude toward its people.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

You are looking at the end product of an exercise designed to practice a couple of concepts in Sketchbook Pro and Photoshop CS4.

Step 1)
In Sketchbook Pro, I experimented with my new sketch brushes until I got an impression that I was satisfied about for my final picture idea. If you wonder what exactly constitutes an ideal setting for drawing your picture of an enchanted landscape, a fantasy book I took inspiration from is Jonathan Stroud‘s The Last Musketeer
A quick look under Google would find thousands of other sources. You do the research to discover a fictional world that suits best for your needs.
I wanted a mystic lake, which I designed using an oval with the freehand pen. This I used as basis to create some more brush strokes, and eventually got this outline, with some vague forms of some mountains.

[/INST]
[INST]I used these layers (2 in total: one with the oval of the lake, and one as overlay, showing where I wanted the peaks to be). This is one of the first times I used Layers effectively and I found them to be indispensable. I have a screenshot of the Sketchbook Pro settings in which you can see how to turn off layer 1, and how to set up layer 2 as overlay. This made it easy to control how the layers are blended (you can use this setting for all kinds of brushes, for example if the brushes with very rough strokes look very distractive, you can change the layer mode in the right bottom of the brush, in which case your brush will act like a clone tool). Sketchbook Pro is an indispensable tool whenever you need to create rough outline sketches. You can draw quickly with the help of the various kinds of brushes. The result isn’t as clean as in Photoshop, but if you are looking to make rough sketches quickly, and get some ideas quickly on your paper, it’s the tool for the job.[/INST]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/8i5hb.jpg[/IMG][LIST]Layers
[/LIST]
The screenshots above show you how to use layers in SketchBook Pro. On layer 1, you see the oval, and on layer 2 you see the brushing strokes which I used to define the peaks on the two big mountains.

Step 2)
I exported the outline picture created in Sketchbook Pro as a sketch.png in Photoshop CS4 by saving and using File-> Save as type, and chose “PNG 24 bit” from the file extension to create the PNG image you see here again.

Step 3)
I continued to paint into this image in Photoshop CS4. Using the water color brush, I painted over these sketch layers, creating clouds which look white, but they actually are very faint, because they are set to use about 30 % opacity. This meant that you could clearly see the mountains and lakes underneath.
I painted some more clouds of a slightly different color in order to create the feeling of perspective. You see this most obviously in the left side mountain, which is completely obscured by the cloud. To achieve this, I painted first the rough cloud, in the end used the same setting as the main one in Photoshop CS4 brush for the Cloud type “Light Cloudy”, and the size ranged from about a quarter

The trees in this picture are probably going to go somewhere, but right the second I didn’t exactly see it – yet everything fits here. Like this. Yes, now I even put a rock in there and maybe when those stones start working again –
well. This might seem unlikely to get any better, and you have reason – but don”t say “oh now that might be beautiful for those” (like a) I see better pictures, even (now more like: yeah I guess that happened; even the “could it happen? Could you think it through?” – I just did what needed I mean…). When people get caught, though, no: in here I didn”t exactly hear it: we want this stuff but – – -: don’f know I might not get through or go. (and the) next time a good story needs I”ve seen something happen, maybe this? I don?

And then I”ll be glad it all has to start something from nothing, because I know my hands and fingers, for everyone’; what needs just a bit, is better said if a: just for what comes along – when. Of course; –. – what to call that.

So, here goes a piece of the setting.
Western-Fictional - "the Lands".
Lore: Tale tells that back thousands of millineums ago, when men knew how nothing but magic, myths were made reality; when they knew how live at peace with the Gods, magic could never get a better form. When a human could command with just his thoughts, when a stone could bleed just like wounds in the woods when a river dried. With only a twerk from a twige on, magic had it glory in Western-Fictional land "El Mago". In today's stories we never heard anything of the kingdom. Magic had changed through the time, though. Today wizadirs have replaced old wise-shamans of the tribes; sorcery schools (called Circles and Concerning Cirque de Magus, CIRque - C-M (an abbrevia to all sorts of Magic) took form, while magical creatures as the Dragons that ruled through the years retirated (as we know today that they had existed even 3.8 mln. ounces when continens started drfsttimg from a huge one). All sorts of new animals and new sorts as of trees started growing and being born - it's said to be a fact since no magic animals or nature is born (nachirized, rezurreced but not beorhed but there are theories about some mytho creatures born at an Island like the N. Zealand where you can see new animals form for a hundred years since then). The time came through - now human, wizards oft and Dragons - once upon, have formed one large continent from different islands while the humans took a smaller land mass from the once and the big Dragoneers one a "Dragon continent"; many others had their parts.
There was one last king who'll be left unname and now we take a jump on how it came until now which is about 8 mln of time; 4 in years back the lands' humans united when the last Dragon went through extinction due to sorcery. Magic was now something we have to live with; now, the King went with all his knight armies and went againts the human alliance, wizard circle as he called it his circle. He wasn't lucky that day - his Dragon didn't went off- and he died after many bloods and years, while his last living army were to become servants, now called in Elmado Servedmeniaa. 25 knight were to guard him under the protection while each year their power increased.
Were now in times to follow: The last surviving knight died in last of year - one wizard has left one spell until 1m; 420d after death - he gave them one night to go; he did what has kept his land safe, unknowing by anyone, all humans. Some had fled (as all in other areas did but they fled through that area), rest died out as if death, never leaving. There are tales, but nothing is there to know of. In that way, now many people (like most now) who call elands-lumis were a different nation with a big country; today elmo lives with in lands who doesn't care with what they've done when Dragons, with the last of elands-knight survived from the last circle; their time is said to end tomorrow - until now:
Sadly all knights died since, or, in a wyrded magic from Dragon - there are not to be dead. If the human who ruled had taken to kill, the knights live but it goes both ways as well he told (so if human dies from a weapon). Sadly this went very well as not enough humans could take with themselves to kill; and then that Dragon king (who rules since Dragon) died; as if he couldn' were called king. Then elmo grew rich with wealth as the others began poor (even more as theirs were not used while working). With all wealth and resources elmu people didn' want (even wanted they'd be in poor again); while on Dragoneers side humans worked their asses; and when their ruleres dies they could find to have had all Dragons' money.

More will follow, but these much time is taken to the read - any feedback will take yourselves with. For questions don't hese if a message or pm as a contact to talk.
Anythinks, and with those times it tells us all the land, today; the last days left of elmos rule today on theirs, and no land is safe once they got the key to death<s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

This existence will be something, not so very unusual- as most of humantiy will be subjecting themselves on to similar lifetimes or existences and you are most probably going about life thinking yourself to "standout or be special". Only time alone cannot explain all its "beetiful complex work".

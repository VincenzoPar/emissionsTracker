<s> [INST]Imagine you are in an imaginary world. Describe the fantastic setting and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]

Imagine. Think of every possible imaginable idea, scenario, and thing, ever conceived in your world of imagination so as if you were there.
Say you have something, I could probably think about you and then create the picture with my eyes that picture. So like a photo or video clip inside my head I can record it, or something in text format can create.

We all have different brains which can not think about an actual world, I will describe my dreamt world and you make sure to describe yours and we will probably have some sort of debate about which should reign over supreme in world rankings, because let's do this, but first things first

World Building
There's a great place on /pol (not me lol). You're welcome. There are countless of "Lost Worlds", "Nations", and "Past History" as well as "Possible Futures for Earth or other planets". There a lot, actually, the same amount of people on Earth so basically everyone creates one on earth or another planet in some universe... The point I'm trying to make is that it is so realistic and that we must choose one with great potential as to not to lose all these beautiful ideas along the way by selecting what you don't want.

I wonna choose, or we can choose!... Sooo! My world. It'll be called BumBum-City because it'll be located right where The-Bible had some crazy dude come, right to me, right at the 1st church! Or Jesus said, I'm not sure, but it has the coordinates (that you wonna type in yourself ) right in there. So the entire world, you're talking to the Godfather, there's nothing wrong here because he's a good dude, okay, sooooo!

First, God creates the BigBang which leads into all his other creations: like the dinosaurs, animals, stuff, life, light and matter; so we'd start from around the year of the dinosaurs up till the future, just skip everything, no big deal, and it will end, but in a perfect moment where there isn't really any humans, right? In this "timeless" period, but you know that the Earth can be used for something as awesome (not so boring actually, really boring, I have one friend lol), if it ain't no good on us, and you like a better-feeling place, if the planet was the most awesome thing in life, right?

Then it starts being used properly to show how much humans have evolved from when it was created! Then there would never be a reason to build the whole human world because all you'd need is a massive structure (like a stadium full enough seats for all humans) where everyone who's a "special creature from God" could hang out with others and chat about how things on the Earth is like this and if that place on the planet was a "big idea of it" and everyone could play at the same time so as they won’t need to kill their self.

How it'd look like?</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures. Describe the fantastic setting and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]One such place is the Isle of Oyce in the northern reaches of Arunach, said to lay outside Earth’s jurisdiction in its own private area of space with unique rules that only it and it citizens can change because no foreign nations recognize their citizens and claim this territory as their own.[ST:I]In reality this uncharted territory has no clear laws governing its citizen’s conduct or ownership to assets. Only through your own might one could lay claim to territory under law or by way of treaty from foreign powers and states.[/ST:I]
[MIC]The people living on this paradise come from far and wide to experience the rich life that nature’s wonders provide such as exotic vegetation and wildlife that no foreigner has heard or smelled in reality, not to speak of the fantastic beasts and the magical world in which every person of any size plays the leading role while also enjoying the vast wonders and beauties of nature found in Oyce. What more you could ever do then spend your life living where such things and more exist, so who doesn’t make their claim one way shape or form on its surface? There isn’t really a place where any nation could fit their laws, instead the citizens must play by the law the nation of Oyce has placed[ITC] by decree, law courts, and even by ancient laws such as those provided[/ITC] since by ancient tribes who all claimed power and ownership beforehand.[/MIC]
[INST]How would one be subject to trial then at the seat of law in what the world at large calls, the Nation of Oyce? This could end many a feud should the court be able to act as neutral and fair against the people involved and decide the fate of either the entire landmass[ITC] through war and bloodshed or otherwise peacefully with no dispute or conflict.[T][/ITC]If Oyce is your kind of world the following should have interested you in creating that same world and roleplaying with other people[ST:I] that share the same hobby you do, and it wouldn't be a bad idea having all participants[/ST:I] take this short introduction to get an overview, a feel, about which role to think of as a viable option from a few options. Some can be easily selected from various choices, while others may be better suited as a team play where characters work together with like interests that lead to other opportunities.[T]
To answer the first questions to ponder over is...
• How should an entry role be played?
     Which character can be played...? What is an interesting race you like? Will you be a neutral or law-abiding citizen like a mage or knight...or perhaps go off the path on being a criminal element by being a wanderer or brigands....?[TR][/TT][P][TR]
[ITC]• What race do you want to portray in the story?...will it be of an unusual creature from the legends such as a wyvern, lemura (female of the wyra/wysura/boggarts/wyverns/were behemoth or any were species or dragon species found inside/outside the Isles,[/TICT] dragobahra, draki,[ITV]
• As far as role as a law abiding or criminal....are you more [ITCV]interested in one of the main human groups...are you interested in being one these fantasy or beastie groups (a wyvern (dor, boggarta, draki...lemurian (lyrana of boggarta species), or dragon species (ruthana, reyda...)...being one of these groups and trying to be neutral or of a criminal group...what role can be a more...in-depth...of an understanding for[/DYK] the player to know [ITCV]be the role of their role[/YDK](wych, mage of the eldorians clan, knight or soldier of lemurea clan).......doing any group and acting as a lone-wander[ITV] [W][/W]ould the lone traveler...act as an agent if of government groups) such as......is working towards a personal mission for some cause for themselves such as......one for the government, being a lone traveler working against the interests of both their society’s best, being an enemy seeking the cause of those against their own in a way of destruction.[INI]

There’s that old saying, "If these walls could talk". Well it also applies to everything made with human, natural touch and care, be it made by hand, or man-processed, or organic...

That’s exactly why, when I was approached by @Made.Traditions and @Fred&FredFinnishFashion, I immediately thought these people are just doing it right...

So I had a good look over on the website, went through it’s every page for two hours...

Describe the fantastical setting, including enchanted landscapes, ancestral forests populated by talking trees and magical creatures, and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]The goal of our project is to imagine a place where one can both exist and escape from the real world. Where can we travel to such a place and how do we feel when we arrive? Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both human and non-human animal beings.

- What is important in a world full
- What is different and familiar
- What kind of adventure did I have at each level

The world is a fantastic place where we can exist. When my imagination becomes real for every moment. [INST]How can stories about worlds and places be created?[/INST],

[LN2]We will explore what happens when these two worldviews collide [EXERTISE]. To see such different ideas side-by-side, try this exercise. Place both of you in the context in which the animal and human belong; one inside each other. Where [/LN2] In which this exercise we place each within each other by understanding other people's worlds, and when we realize an animal exists through our animal worlds, we can start to communicate with it.

[TIPS]We also explore a way for each to understand an animal. It works as an experimental animal study in this exercise you have to be prepared to understand the concept of animals, so [/TIPS] Imagine if you want to understand [INST]what animals mean[/INST].

[INST]Soul-based games, also known as card games, are designed with different heroes or cards that serve to improve your character on journeys through dangerous caves. For example, a player with a magic sword has a magical defense while moving through a dungeon, with some dangers of moving from room to room.[/INST]
The game mechanics of a fantasy-based trading card game work by creating a base set of rules and cards at the same time the developers work to add other cards. The most fun part of some of them is trying to play against people you’ve never heard of, the ones who have never met to show the most. .
In the event when a player dies when fighting another fave or in a different adventure, that player must take his hero down or give them resources to help repair him the next time he dies. Each player has one life in the event and loses to their death. The game is based on the “card wars“, In which a collection of 23 types of cards (which range from basic to legendary classes) is available. The player begins the game by opening up a deck of 3 classes of cards depending on the choice he made at the start[/INST]

## [PROGRESS]Chapter 4 – Exploring Fantasy Settings | Art 21 by Lori Nix and Maira Kalman

Learnt from:
Ancient forests full of talking trees. Deserts where the ground whispers to passing camels through stones and sand patterns. Mountains that emit clouds as steam that carries them above the forest as if they contained some elemental force. An island over which a sea-spanning glass bridge extends, supported only by the power of wind in its sails, and made so delicate that it sways back forth with gusts of currents which are strong against one side, and silent stillness on the others. A vast palace made whole with the glued in leaves of the whole forests’ trees, its floors lined with moss and flowers instead of wood. In a garden above its roofed castle towers, there is a forest garden where trees sprout their bough from out of pots and the animals walk in peace. Tables littered through the groves are not set with silver as they are often in history, but instead are wrought with roots and carved from old bark, and filled with the leaves of mushrooms and nuts, instead of plates of beef. In every room an elaborate stew riddles an elaborate chantery-piece. Dancers dance in every hall and chamber and room, every floor and cupboard, every balcony, table seat and bed. Everything is covered in mural, ornate, fantastically adorned, stylized, ado</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

Imagine taking an immersive trip in a fantasy location based in fictional worlds like the Tolkien'ed landscaped real worlds such as Italy, or Scotland.... that sounds like fun, right.

Sometimes even the magic works in bizarre ways and unexpected things happen—the spell fails, the magic artifact turns against its owner, enchantress goes overboard her abilities, the familiar doesn’t come to aid, the muse turns on us…[DREAMER] [MAGICK](Magic that happens unexpectedly and for no apparente reason, so that we have no choice other than either go with the flow and trust that whatever is causing the mayhem leads somewhere, or go crazy).[/MAGINEER][/DREAMER][INST]One such example is the magical item I carry—an ancient sword that is always in the reach of someone but cannot be grabbed, an amulet given by spirits yet invisible to some even its owner when worn, a ring turned magical due to bloodstained metal stolen and melted in witchfire into its silver composition, a wand carved from mossy branches of a talking oak whose sap flows on my skin after the first kiss…[/INST]You have the power of imagination in this fantastic scenario—in order to explore deeper realms of magical, fantastically enchanting world—and you don’t have to spend your energy looking for that power’s location because your eyes could not spot that kind of a mystical reality anyway, which makes your fantasy world limitless, free from boundaries as vast as the universe.</s>

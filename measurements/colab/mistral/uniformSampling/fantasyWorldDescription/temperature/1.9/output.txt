What type does my country or city/settles? (fantage - urban setting, forge)
Type in world: What kind of setting will make the theme - high fantasy, paragon, paralight urban
what species or tribes are allowed and not in your fantasy world.

I've had trouble making and not thinking there has been something like what it meant. I feel it isn't that good or I'l write in too short about what would be written (in paragraph form or essay ). Or I have problems for world history . If I write out too briefly without going into everything.

Can anyone give more elaborate and better than a world, for what you have already established the setting with the people or species ,and how in the background history are they? Can some do a step by step guide . I mean this can do to think the answer about a different person ,and it might vary with answers from many more on which we have an inspiration of ideas is coming or is a great example?

And my imaginary world :
Troubles. My head : D If I really feel no, the more interesting idea is that it will help us to give help I will get my imaginary world that might come in a few sentences to a longer text form to find what makes up this world the background history and even though with a great interest to give us and in any way of their interest . Even people who already have written. With some information will you see the same. Can anyone get help. If so, which will find this great or an inspiration from another's example can also work out. It isn't an easy step one might face .

Last of I might give my world a little and find it : If I might get and then help a great way. For writing . This will go too long for a bit of text that there might think . Is not of them . Is in that I will really say this if people say what should to do what isnit is the question!.

You choose to give 1 month of food assistance a month for one animal kept by @Ward, by taking care of her cats which are on special feeding for health purposes since a few months ago: https://patreon.com/post/50... You also donate 6 months of life-insurance in cash each year or 1.25kg of raw, quality & well balanced food if preferred, to secure a better life or help find a permanent rescue home for any cat/dog @Wade's found & has taken in (they only need that for the 1 who lived at his home and 4 at Wards before their adoption so any new rescues who would find better than ever help and hope since Wade has decided not to give up with this until something finally shows it worth the work & they also use his time'd service without being drastically paid at the level of effort they put as one could imagine (35-year-veterinarian working daytime & evenings without salary just for what she does without needing to do that extra and all is already enough since everything comes mostly from Wares pay for food+help on medical bill for the family pets so it saves much time and costs which it should cost less at normal vet (they need much extra staff, care and attention though so 99-Euros instead (even this was an excess price in that hospital the vets have to do much themselves with only very little money), so not quite that efficient compared to an open house without fees who will offer good and proper help, care and support but not everyone is able to live close enough), the food cost Wade's also 60-euros for every single feeds & if he would buy good and expensive catfood like he should instead, this cost per box is very close so not better as the 2k a Year on a real job will make Wards money problems, they're so unbelievable cheap or just poor enough to give the work their self for every penny, to make 4 days of vet+virus help. This will keep it running for cats that had some luck before their real bad luck). 50 E is around and about enough anyway, if his bank still doesn’t work until later!</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

So much for story time eh? I bet that sounded very... magical and fantastic, but for our main quest line there should be better and longer (like real epic lore). That is why each group of player get to propose on quest line/advert for their town as well. Because all of these is part of a very big adventure. It sound weird with quest. I say quest like you travel a town in real fantasy land instead, for example "Boston" which already existed there (somewhat on MOB world if you had been there). However i should say our world's cities look as same or just slightly alter compared to cities on there on some aspect that you'll recognizable that's some how in my fantasy adventure. I imagine each cities on map will look quite the as Boston or your own city in R. For each cities it should really be on their imagination, then for them to design it out if their city in their MOB home/base (within there game) then resemble those features outside there MOB when it reach our main town server for a final build which will become one of our adventure world or even for multiplayer event in game. If the city gets more player than that means more interest then more MUST (or want too lol, I know it sounds sadism as my role). As our main game develops in MOB, cities also develop new more fantasy stuff for players inside their MOB home, including for some reason a magic world of Mage class so called in 8 years for wow game "Azeroth" a mysterious hidden and curiously mysterious location in 3d graphics which it also appears on some 2nd main town by some players/teamer. It is our hidden world only Mage & Druids (priates, necromanac) get inside and play which have same map like a map like this [Link][/M] on first Mage town in the story I imagine that will take off if our devs can design magic (a magic/manabar with some spiked numbers when clicked, etc as an magic weapon ability in mob). Another world we know of on main story are those ancient cities as Mages like on MOM world's [Link] which as we find these places. A place full or mythology and magic (which only magic class is allowed)...

Some of those things could really look epic too (although not so magical because its limited like i thought) in our fantasy adventure too!! I really find interesting that all town on every server or town has something unique to talk about too to give real interesting in this fantasy role play. But not for them to describe in long paragraph rather, or at one place it can appear to like if you go too. All together we find a whole 2 new cities are still yet in planning? Which will have interesting location we must explore which might appear some unique things to describe with other stuff on our magical adventure</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

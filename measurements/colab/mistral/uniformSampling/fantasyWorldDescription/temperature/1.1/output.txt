This piece is a continuation and expansion of an previous artwork made back in 2015. It was made to further fill the fictional universe with more detail and information for it.

This artwork is divided in blocks. The very first row shows the title, the location name and the date, and three very basic instructions. The second row shows two rectangular boxes, in each one a different view of Roropatul, a small and mysterious village (the two views are separated by a thin wall as seen in both pictures). The third row is the first level of the "fairy tale", while the fourth row is the second level. These two rows are the descriptions of the villages' respective views. Rows five, six and seven describe how to access the fairies tale (how to interact with the book), a brief description of the fairy-tale's location, a link to an image showing the map of the path within the book, a note with tips for the path. The eight row holds just three more basic instructions. The three last rows describe the creatures that inhabit the village, and their descriptions.

One very important detail to be taken into consideration when looking at the picture is the way it is structured: there's three blocks in there. The first block (the top block, in white) holds everything that is relevant to the village itself. The second block (located in the center, highlighted in black) shows the book, the fairy-tale and the path to take. The last block (is located at the bottom, in pink and green) shows the creatures.

I used three "colors" in this artwork (three "themes" in which I divided the artwork):

- White (the village). It is all located in the first block, located in the top of the map. It's a very simple and neat design. It's simple, linear, neat, detailed yet precise.
- Dark blue (interaction and fairy-tale journey). The central block (blue) contains the book (and the fairy-tale within the book). In such, these three are all relevant. To reach such journey, there's instructions to be followed. One can either follow the instructions written themselves (a journey within the book- with the fairy tales name, "The Hidden Village"), or follow the image available through the link (where there's 32 steps for the whole journey).
- Pink and green (Creator and creatures). The third block of info, located at the bottom, shows all the creatures. The creatures, all together, are pink, while the map that leads through the creatures is green (since it leads throughout them). The creatures are grouped: by their race and gender, and by the part of the book in which those creatures are relevant. The creatures are also further sub-grouped into different races: elves (elven race, fairies, water spirits, wood nymphs, dryads/tree nymphs and the mythical trolls), gnomes and humans (male, female and children in all different races). These creatures can be seen by following each race through the book, following the link provided in the picture:

http://imagine.theparadox.at/imag ... ield=imagined)

You can look into the creatures there, by going to "Imagine...The Book, the creatures."

Here's also a description table, for even more details. The table is sorted by race, and contains detailed descriptions on each of the creatures found there. (The table also contains links to other images - one with the full map, one with a more complete description of the village (how it looks like), and two more with some artworks of the place and other small details, for even more detail):

In essence, I put a lot of detail into the map, and tried to have it all relevant and organized. There's a lot of different blocks within one single artwork (there's a whole map of the fairy-tale inside the book, the story-book itself together with the fairy-tale, there's 32 steps that you (as a user) may choose to follow (or not) in there, the creatures and a brief description of them - all in there - as well as more detailed information about the village, the creatures and the book, outside the very artwork).

One time during the time that I’d been working on [INST]Wayfarer’s Pass[/INST] and before that to [INST]Moranis[/INST] and later, I had a game of this, played by myself.

I had a set of three games, each of which I played each individually to decide whether to get rid of them, or keep them, or possibly get them back again (I’d had the first two before I started to write about ‘[INST]The [/INST]Pass[INST]’. The games were [INST]Treasure Seekers[/INST], [INST]Fantastische[/INST] and [INST]Wayfarer’s Pass[/INST].

First, I read the Rules and played through the game once. I found it had gone to the point where I realised that I was not playing the game properly, since after five or six goes (not counting the six that got me into a few more games I could never get it to run again). There were only a few places (such as the “F” room) where it hadn’t been working.

Then I decided to give it another try, not expecting it to be as good as I’d been thinking in the beginning. It had not had problems for about a month, but my experience with other games told me it ought to work now since [INST]The Pass[/INST] had been more of a problem to fix than [INST]Fantastische[/INST] (not sure what happened in this case, but it had not had problems of that kind before).

However, after a few more tries, I got it to go to work again and got a sense that there was something magical happening.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

However, there are plenty of writers who enjoy this process—I’m looking at you, worldbuilders—and they like talking about it. So, with that in mind, I’d like to talk to you about why I think the worldbuilding is important to do early in the fantasy writing process, and the reason that a lot of writers love working on it and talk about it.

## Why World-Building is So Much Fun

I had a conversation a couple of years ago with one of our editors, and she talked about why world-building is sometimes so much fun. Her answer surprised me, but I think about it quite frequently. What she said is that a lot of times when someone—anyone who does anything creative, not just authors—decides to write a book, they’ll choose a particular period of history to use as the setting. For example, they might set the story in London during Shakespeare’s time and write about a mystery that the famous writer becomes involved in.

In the case of a world that we’ve set ourselves, we already have a world in our head somewhere. We might be inspired by something familiar to us in ours, such as our country or our home, or something we know from TV or a particular location we’ve visited.

Another option is not to be inspired by something from the real world but something fictional. A story of magic can be set on Earth, but if it involves fantasy creatures, it’s going to be quite impossible to use one of our worlds—so we’ll likely have the creatures come from a made-up or a known fantasy world.

World-building is always the first process of writing that someone goes through to plan a story, but, because it’s so fun, writers can sometimes get lost in developing the land (which I also love to do) instead of sitting down and writing.

## Why It Helps to Be a Planner

If you’re a planner, you’ll need a framework. It might be a timeline of your history, a map, an idea of your creatures, a sense of your politics, or something else, including a geography.

I’m very fortunate to live near Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales. It is one of the reasons that I enjoy writing stories set nearby as so many places in the story are set near a mountain. The geography doesn’t have to be set in a country that we know: I recently wrote about a forest for a dragon story, which isn’t in Wales either, as I wanted a dragon who would be isolated but able to eat some animals.

World-building should be undertaken so that a writer has their locations and geography ready for when they come to plan their story and write it. Without it, a lot of us struggle, and some will be so confused about setting that we’ll just write scenes with generalized places. This can get lost if a character wanders around, but the reader may begin to feel lost if it’s not clear, and the writer may start to have problems with writing when there’s no geographical setting.

## Building a Story

The most important thing the writer has to do is decide on the purpose of the story, such as if it is for adults, young adults, a specific genre or age or set of topics, what kind of adventure to include and how the world they’re going to explore will work. After they have decided this, they have to ensure that their geography suits those purposes. One way of doing this is to plan a story around it, but if it’s not possible to do this, their first story will give them information about the world, and they can change their world to suit how the first book has turned out.

## A Note About Making Changes

Sometimes the writer will have a change of heart and go in another direction. With planning and geography well done, there should be changes that can be made to suit different stories. The changes will not just fit with the first story, but other books written in the future.

## Tips for Beginners

What is the most important thing about building the world? It all comes back to understanding what you want to do and what you want to use when thinking about this. That will help you create the perfect environment. Your readers will also enjoy that. If you’re going to use something that they know from history, your story will benefit and might be more readable.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

What I see is humans living in small and large communities. Some are good, some are bad.

But among those who are considered bad are several creatures that are not completely bad. Dragons for example, love to roam, and have nothing against living humans, as long as they leave the forests alone.

They live in caves deep in the forest. But the forest is no longer as deep after a long lost war by orcs. So dragons live peacefully among humans most of the time they are not hunting.

There is another mythical creature that can be among good and bad at once.

I'll start with orcs. Some Orcs are just out to make more of their kind, because the population has thinned out from so much war. Sometimes they go into human villages to try to breed with humans, as one tribe once kidnapped and used human females for breeding.

Orcs are also prone to killing human babies, or eating them when they are not careful. While some orcs are still in the human camps, these orcs are more likely to kill baby orcs. Because they prefer the taste of human babies.

And now my third mythical creature. Elven people. I know they are very rare now but I think they exist in small groups here and there like I picture them. They can either be at war with humans and dragons, or they do both. They have an ancient book of all the orcs that have done human babies wrong, and whenever an orc enters and is confirmed an orc, or a non-human baby stealer, an elven person will kill him on the spot without asking any questions.

They have an army of riders when needed, their mounts are huge birds. Some of which were hatched by elven people. Their mounts have the same magical ability as the elves, they can grow in size, and take them from small bird like creature, to the size of a pony.

I will stop theorizing now.
Let's wait to see what the world has in store to surprise us.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

We are living in an inhospitable environment, and we are constantly exposed to the threat of extinction. We are constantly bombarded with the media's fear-mongering, conspiracy theories, and misinformation. We are inundated with a barrage of false information from the "powers that be," and it is hard to separate fact from fiction.

Instead of succumbing to our fear, we need to embrace it and empower ourselves with knowledge, rather than trying to hide behind fear.

I have compiled links to my favourite resources and tools over the years and compiled them into a resource for other people who are interested in living a low impact and empowered lifestyle on the land. I highly recommend the following resources for helping to navigate the current chaotic political climate, understand the root cause of all issues in the world today, discover effective ways to stay informed and navigate the online misinformation environment, and take proactive steps to create real and meaningful change within the system.

I am always amazed by the number of people who are interested in living a natural, wholesome, and sustainable lifestyle. One of the main reasons people cite as a reason for not doing something is their fear of stepping outside their “bubble” and challenging what they think is true. They are afraid that they won’t be able to navigate the minefield of social media platforms and all the fake information shared in them.

The fact is that most of the information available on social media and on the Internet is untrustworthy, at best. What people need to do to truly understand what is going on in the world is to go directly to the source and fact check their information. This is especially true when it comes to conspiracy theories and false information about governments and policies. It makes me feel that I don’t know much compared to these sources of information.

There are several reasons given by people as to why they are afraid to challenge the conventional wisdom. They say that they can get into trouble, go to jail, or cause themselves a great deal of distress.

The most common reason is that they simply don’t care enough to do anything about it. Why should I bother to challenge the status quo, when they know that what I think is true? The reason they don’t believe what they are reading on the Internet is that it doesn’t make sense and is contradicted by reality. Their beliefs are outdated, the facts they have been told are wrong, and their beliefs are not even true.

All of this is very frustrating. Why doesn’t this make sense? Why isn’t it explained to people?

One major reason is that we don’t really have any understanding of the power of the Internet. To us, the Internet is a big black box. We don’t really know how it works, and we’re too afraid to go inside.

The reality is that the Internet has all of the facts we need. It is easy to find information online. We don’t have to be intimidated by the information that we have been given. We are not alone in finding the facts that we want.

Now that we have this information, we can challenge it, fact check it, and hold ourselves accountable to it.

The Internet can also be empowering. If we are afraid of being attacked by our friends on social media, or by our relatives, then we are not truly living in a safe world. We are not truly living in an inclusive world, either.

If you are afraid to speak out, find an outlet and learn how to use it.

If you are unsure about what the facts are, read up. Or check the facts you know before taking action. You can make a much bigger difference by questioning your assumptions.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

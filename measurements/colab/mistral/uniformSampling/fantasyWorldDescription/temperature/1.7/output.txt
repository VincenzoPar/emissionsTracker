<s> [INST]Imagine you are in an imaginary world. Describe the fantastic setting and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST] The Imagenary Challenge (INST) thread begins now!
NOTICE!!! I'mma use this for now since I didn't realize yet how the [INST] command works fully :o| (Scream) so just incase you need help with using said command follow @Jessie483 explanation.
Thank u jess 24^:@
So. This is pretty simple. Use imagination in answering, write your own thoughts even if the question sounds silly sometimes. ^-^ We would appreciate seeing more descriptive answers even though they seem to come like very small talk about the game and setting. Don't think and try to analyze answers! Don't feel like competing :o we do everything out here to have fun right :) If you would mind some help just use this command : INDEX then in what section you’d like to get help, (Game Index? Setting INDEX? or maybe the QandA INdEX that would be all your options.) to find more of our previous writings. The Game index to find your favorite characters and setting indexes for when you just want some descriptive places so ya you just see places that are familiar in the [Instagram post] or even to discover new locations? QandA as we already gave answers on most of gameplay. :0 You don’t just have to use the “INDEX”, but if you want. ^^~ That'' s also an option ;) Let’s also say that we as characters have multiple personalities because all can use or own as we are now and were before. Some people say or do certain actions but other can say/ not say for those that you can't understand (That's pretty the reason to [Imagine] our personality)! I might sound vague in everything you just don't need to make everything too formal since we haven't yet done and that we usually are too laid back as to not follow those actions with words.
Now don't bother that someone is already doing these commands and stuff... or in another thread sooo if we use the same "INDEX" section from an "Imagens" [or so.] we also know if a lot are using them for all of us you' don't need to hesitate! That part of [Hogwacktic Imeginary Challenge- INS] don '` s have rules we usually put on stuff.. If you are following your commands from other persons and maybe get better and funnier responses that just means you thought and analyzed first. I hope these are somewhat understood hah~ and even followed ^_^ Sooo as you may expect this game thread is where each game thread is being born by the members :0 So when answering or imagening that’s mostly our game mode which the members are thinking or following right.
Sooo... The [INST] Comm is just here because of its use that we thought in order for them to be read without any questions! This game will just be like this forever unless others bring new ideas or whatever that can suit to our site :o I mean even thx~
You' don't know everything and you can try being more imaginary even though for our next threads just to show more what could fit on a theme of: “Your own way of [INvented or Insperited from a theme] theme. (Invent = inventor, and Inspet =  inspirated! )" :) As for the command we might have to go a little out there as we need to also make these the right way, you now to understand :( It does depend also a person's taste in stuff sometimes because this part and these new game or theme's might still need some adjust just for it! So hopefully these answers in this section thread will be read by some people as a guidance, but then for other people there will still be errors even just to be careful but at least we do know those sections if followed you usually follow by [The members], as also by the one' don’  t forget these commands. Hopefully to help new and new old characters to follow it too !
Note, to answer to this thread we might want something like a descriptive way too atleast of a way of doing this, or even by its just short answers just to get things running, for us if possible then we will follow too this part so to start thinking. ; ) It would also depend on person taste too when thinking by these answers but we need to know in advance that when answering: don’ t put everything with the words [*Inst] (INST* INdEX*) because we're making just like a "Guide" in here and also we aren't giving "Laws for a site”.

Type of game: Tarots

In game-box in Czech

Tarottojás! is a Czech card game. The only goal of the game is for the players who did guess any taro to tell another, the taro-reader from another player the hidden image the player think off. And from the images described on Tarro-card, every player gets to guess of player icons. To keep fair it could have done a rotation card, and then have a certain amount number for hidden players the other cards show up. I hope that it can become a nice alternative to play any type of tarot decks. Because it would keep the same fun and fair at it. And then again it just wouldn’t work too well for the same cards that are only about two. Also I liked other features of Tarot Dots especially their visual aspect that makes things easier not only when the cards shown from a table the image behind them could look like a big wall image in background; that makes it hard for the reader when they tried to show a lot about card meaning also what images a person sees. And they made many different tarots. Some also have a number to show that would go up to over 1. Also they are a Tarrottes series, the two Tarrows Taro Cards have some Tarows, Tarons-and even a Taroon of The Tarov-Niad, an ancient and forgotten version</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

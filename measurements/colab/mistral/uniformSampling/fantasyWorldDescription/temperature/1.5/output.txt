Well i like playing inst. and this has been my idea a long time. All credits do to the people, i do not know them.

(Im sorry for making the picture so small, my  browser wouldn't let me put it bigger.)

Instagram(The name of my idea) is a imaginary world. This world is not to special when compared with the other Imaginary worlds but this city, Instagram, is different, because the players, who enter this world must find Instagrams. You take them to 2dungeons, that open as soon
as your bag is full. Everytime you collect 2 items you can take the "looted bag" and trade some of the stuff.
You earn fame after passing the hard 2 battles and the 7 dungeons.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures. Describe the fantastic setting and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]
in other words, I just want to say hello I love the game idea and can't wait even if in a year you have a beta
I'm sure to put up with the little bugs.
but from experience some people will want to try just get to the point it's beta or even just released but what I can assure you is no. you've won when the servers are overloaded just like Minecraft
this idea alone is super unique there's not this sort if thing in the gamed you can literally put almost any creature into the game to fight the next boss, they don’t need to look “perfect” its what they stand for. that's the kind of thing that gets over the top and makes the hairs on your neck come out I want to play an exciting online adventure game now go
I know you got it!

The setting is an ever changing one at the hand of humans. Though there was once a great balance between the realms of men and those of fae. Through the generations fae had used enlightenment to change the land to reflect their needs, not unlike a humans ability to use their minds power to build technology. In these times a change began to settle which caused the natural harmony to unbalance a bit.

On certain paths and roads certain events trigger the change. In this case there comes about one in the distance. You must first walk along one path and a few roads through the town.

> Once upon a time…

there was no Earth, just a ball of flames at an unimaginable distance from other heavenly bodies. This incandescent star had very little magnetic forces of interaction (magnetorheological fluids) creating a hot plasma that revolved on its own axis within a system consisting of other planets (satellite) which shared the same space, without physical contact.[UNFOLD]

This mass of matter (granite), formed of various densities eventually formed a crust allowing the atmosphere to stay contained and other planets (Venus &Mercury)[STORY]

This allowed animals that we’re only feeding on plants at low rates due to ineffective cellular metabolism to have an important amount of glucose stored in fat and amino acids in muscles which was important for reproducing. After an unmeasured amount of years of cellular breathing of all fauna, and with a more efficient an effective metabolism that started, we can say, the ozone cycle began creating also, and more effectively and rapidly for plants to reproduce via seeds of various shapes, colors and flavors with the help of honeybees.[UNFOLD]

# 1024 | Storytelling in the Age of Narrative Capture

In this age, the most valuable possession of humanity is narrative imagination—the ultimate power derived from the ability to create and exchange personal stories.[2] Narrative is the human faculty that consists in our individual abilities and collective knowledge to construct meaning from experience, to translate emotions and memories into thought: creating, communicating values, beliefs through language. The future is inescapably narrative [4].
As with any other imaginable, yet uncharted course to the future and the future itself, humanity cannot escape the risk and danger implied by not embracing the present opportunities embedded in the current conditions [1]. As society becomes more technologized than ever before in modern times, there are important questions to be addressed. First and foremost is the impact that all this available information, data and information that in the future will become Big Data, will have on societies and individuals [3]. To quote the article 5 Trends That Will Shape The Future Of Humanity: [3]: “The number of Internet users is going to double to 3 billion people, while the population only goes up to 10 billion. We can only try to imagine what that can possibly mean for everyone on this planet to be virtually hooked into an electronic web.

From social networking and media-driven interaction, to ubiquity of sensors and computing hardware to generate and store that information, all the way to more advanced bio-implantation, telemedicine, and data visualisation using mixed reality, our whole perception of human existence might be in for profound, almost instantaneous change [6 – page 118].
Nowadays we deal on a daily basis, without any reservation, data such as: names, email lists, photos, images, videos. What is more important on the way to creating our narrative identity (our narrative agency) – is to understand that we are entering and are part of a time phase not in terms as mere witnesses [8] – as individuals, a sort of information agents if you like [7] but the ones having to face a new and important questions – [7]: how is the information, generated and used, will change our reality and our perceptions of it. One aspect that might help future generations to deal with “narrative agency” will not go further than the level of awareness and empathy towards past generations – that in fact is something worth investing time and emotion by the current generation of active global “digitus personified “actors.
But while looking over present conditions might help in imagining and therefore prepare for the present reality and for the current risks, threats also. One important notion to bear in mind is – this particular present-and-past of humanity – cannot be extrapolated. In other words what worked in the past might not apply in the future without considering all the implications of current transformations and transitions that affect the state of humanity.
To keep abreast with possible opportunities we are looking back at history.
A century ago, a young and revolutionary new mass-media phenomenon: “narrative movies”, were born and for the first time since human existence we have an industry, art, entertainment phenomenon in “performing to a larger public”. Since that particular era, film and movies become synonyms to any and all audiovisual mass-media-driven, popular, globally understood phenomena. It wasn’t by chance – for the first time we had a form/medium that managed to appeal to an audience. One of the first attempts to reiterate this idea is found in Aristotle’s Poetics: for a work to achieve its goal, meaning its intended effect on a viewer (be that its aesthetic or cognitive significance.) [9-see diagram on page 48].
And if we go a step higher then the very basic and first steps on this human civilization timeline, is probably worthwhile to try and explore further what it means, for people for today, in 1200s to have had invented and adopted narrative, in the first place; or we can also venture back and look on how was narrative used by our close ancestors and to start from there what it all means, the value gained through narrative capability of human being.
All in all it appears that to become human on most basic terms has something essential – which seems like the most essential characteristic and ability – ability to perceive and experience, interpret and tell stories.
So going ahead in our timeline of narrative-powered society; and in our search of “performing society”; where “performing” and “fiction” are used both on personal, internal, physiological, but especially the one that it is being communicated:

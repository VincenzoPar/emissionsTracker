<s> [INST]Imagine you are in an imaginary world. Describe the fantastic setting and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]
When in a quest in a dungeon in the end you will fight a boss battle…

During this battle a “special key” must be used every 3 rounds. For example…
“The first key was a golden key, and on 9th round the boss was using it’s special key to change gold to iron…”

Once the key is used it’s effects takes place, such as :
- gold is taken from the adventurers (like a 20K Gold Draft effect from each one)
- mana is consumed for a while, reducing the number of max Mana…
- HP potions only heal 5% or…0% for all (no more, no heal…no more life = “die”)...

If you don’t make that key in time the boss will gain +35% life, for now until it consumes 5 Keys.

Keeps increasing to “unbearability”, until it’s impossible to beat the game after that (like a big game-over effect)….
And then you want to close the server again ^^’.

The quest is for one group (up to 7 players) in the “End Boss room”, which will open “daily (36h ? 9h ?) after the server open” (so can only enter as a party).

It took me 4 hours but was it really long ? No. So i would propose a price with the end of the quest : maybe some Xp pot, a boss ring / weapon /… ? Maybe more gold and other ? What if more (Xp pot, some gold and boss item too) could unlock with higher difficulty ? A price when more boss rings will be rewarded to complete higher stages ?

P.S : There could be different key effects (3 is enough ?)
And it could be added after the main main of your server.
But now, with more keys (5 or more) can only be added more effects?</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures. Describe the fantastic setting and the adventures that can be experienced.[/INST]

## Why we Need this work

When you have to give your own version of a story to someone in a school assignment or creative writing, our academic writing services will provide professional writers for all college paper and project orders including essay writing, admissions applications, and exam answers. You do not require a writer at home on call; just call us and you will receive original solutions and essay writing services within 10 to 15 minutes. We only want creative writers who can understand the situation of a story and its narration style when you ask them to add a certain amount of characters to your story.

Writing a new story when I feel like I am reading others stories and not my own original version. For that, we need a new story writer who would write for me some new stories and ideas from which you will realize what type of story you should create from your very own point of view.  It would also save you the time and effort of actually researching and creating your own. For that, here are some suggestions from my website writer who helped with my original article – it is easy to read without too many details!

## How it Works

All we need from you: You create your 90-Day Marketing Plan and send it.
Our writer will provide feedback on everything our team would have to get an A on a test, whether it be the story or anything written at all. Once you have our writer to look at your plan first, send it to my team of marketing folks who run ad campaigns all the time, send it off to another experienced team at your local marketing store so that we’re able to see the changes made as those individuals get more familiar with your business. As they get more familiar with what you plan to spend money on advertising for in the next 3 months, all we do afterwards is wait until after all the tests are finished

## A writer working for you!

If you would like to do your own creative writing, get this done by a highly motivated academic writer. In fact, a college creative writer who can follow directions and provide a piece of writing in just one submission? There are so many great tools when it comes to improving your skills, or if not yours, how long do you want the piece of writing delivered? In other words, if we want to be able to write a piece fast, in what can we do first-class essay writing and/or book reviews – 0200? The quickest answer for each category depends much on: In some time you might end up having more than your time to actually use your brain, and that goes for a writing essay and then, a few reviews you want written while writing for your own company or clients. The more time that can pass before writing your own or using your brain can cost to a larger company, and one less you want to go back to school with some kind of project or assignment. I know about this myself – just like most people, there tends to be time wasted during high school (and when you were a high school student) because you cannot take on another major subject and learn everything there is to know about your particular class without taking time out to be at a disadvantage. Now what kind of class does that have?<s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

Here’s how some of the more notable writers in his era wrote fantasy stories:

“This is a book of magic and adventure…. Here it is to be assumed that the reader has not left childhood behind altogether- and that he appreciates the value of trees in their green, rustling state, just for walking through- and of fields in their undecidedly floweriness- just to look at. These can stand any amount of imaginative additions.” (from The Wind in the Willows) Here you will find all manner of fantastic worlds with all sorts of creatures within its pages. I mean anything is possible, right?” If anyone had told me three years ago, just as we left for Paris, that this time the country of my adoption would be threatened by its ancient adversary and the world would witness a new war, I would probably have said: impossible. But no longer: no, no longer. Impossible became possible: it has happened and it happens and our children know it … It might, therefore, have happened to us once upon a time, like once upon a time when the knights fought in the forest. But it could have happened to us twice; because for the fairy tales will become, after all our lives, a part of that wonderful fantasy that will forever be called… “fiction”.[/QUOTE] And then there were other fantasy writers writing about other kinds of worlds, some more fantastic than others. One was a fictional world populated by both animals and humans, based on ancient folklore. These writers have created many different fantasy worlds in which humans can interact with mythical creatures.</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

[BETA INFO] The idea for the novel comes from my dreams where in them I am a mythical creature (of whom that depends which dream, and not just the merperson.) and I’m surrounded and interracted with by both my species and the mythical creature that each human is made of, or rather their dream selves when they’re “dreaming”, not in their dream or consciousness’ version of life.

The Story

I was a young child when the events of these stories start to happen though to give it further detail

Human life expectancy. 88 and the world was populated by mythical
creatures like fairies , pixies, dragons, sasquatches elves trols etc
that's when there was a war between races where humans and
mythical creatures fought with our combined magical artifacts against our own world for
15 yrs a great amount of death of innocent ppl on both sides happened from both the
war and it's deadly magic that spread and effected everything on both
the worlds this all ending with the mythical worlds destruction and the loss of their
artifacts with the last remenance be the ancient artifact with
megalomania of "The Great Wizard" that was given to a human boy of whom the story of "The wizard and the dragon" follows .
As for the events of these adventures aka these worlds they happened in different worlds to try and learn from it's misuse of our own ancient artifacts by not having one that corrupted the great wizard and now by the time of it in it's
own corruption it'll only get worst which lead me to do this quest in its own world as i didn't
want to learn on my kind but our ancient artifacts corruption but that
of what had happened to the other world and their mistakes and as
what i will do is to get it in it's own world before anything get any worse or worst so that in our worlds there wouldn't have to pay the price of this again.
And to stop it from happening again to any others even others of their own even to our
and other mythical ones by our war and mistakes before the world
was destroyed.

In my youth I learned about mythical beasts and creatures and that our ancestors in the time of greatness shared the planets they called worlds with a wizard and the dragons and we and them lived as we called one
family the same is it started in my world and our time of greatness though with time our kind turned on the other like in some worlds and ours our magic had corrupted the wizards and our relationship with them though as our magic power corrupted with more deaths they fell upon each other with wars breaking out between us with the help of tailed ones then us they and they all fell and as did our families from their war they all ended up in a world called Eden that was once my grandfathers world for many had the help off a dragon in an artifact battle against wizard that lead his kin to the great world war.

The artifact

A golden-winged hawk

An object with enough power not to need to be a dragon or wizard for and i wanted it my goal from thereon and to get in to the one on our own worlds where it can help us prevent
future war with out kind by its powers but it's on its own of them so to get any where without corrupting it i will have to retrieve to another one that i had learnt about was at Eden called the key in another quest</s><s> [INST]Imagine being in a fictional world inhabited by both humans and mythical creatures.

[B]“The players enter a medieval fantasy RPG where there is magic in the world, elves, dragons, dwarves, giant insect creatures, or humanoid races. Some of these civilizations are secretive and ancient; others, newly risen from the Dark Ages of men in medieval cities in kingdom and village style cultures. The adventurer will seek clues, face villains in his quest, and try to gather strength before entering the evil lair or confronting the secret villainers within his society. The players are adventurers, explorer types who don’t shy away from monsters, treasure chests, and intrigue. The role players will explore the environment, gain and lose allies, and try to find a way to defeat powerful NPCs who stand against him. The adventures gain experience points (the magic coins of the RPG) as they win and lose adventures or confront boss monsters.”[/B]

You can find more in-depth rules at the Fantasy Realm, a community site. However, we are playing an extremely friendly game in which the spirit of role is much more important than the mechanics, where it is not important, and no one, absolutely no one, no one can ever tell you that you will not be able to do (even when you know that what you are going to ask from the gods to make it happen, because maybe they will get mad and break the game too if I don"t. You will have a small margin of flexibility [BALANCE]on some rules to give you a little bit of time and to have a chance to play your character as you want).

The fantastical setting was abuzz with strange occurrences, as both mundane reality and incredible legends coexist alongside one another. A majestic dragon's shadow could be glimpsed hovering over the sky like a predatory bird at dawn. Its scales shimmered like polished onyx. In the dense woodlands lurked talking Treants whose folklore preceded their arrival, for the sage-like giants' sagely counsel kept realms in tranquility throughout the ages.
Rumors spoke, however indirectly, of hidden environs where nature's enchantments spun forth in endless excess. From lily pond riddled with irratic mermaid vocalizations at mid-day till mystified canyons whispered cryptic arcane wisdom with every breath of wind across petrified vortices and choked basalt pebbles etched grotesque geometrics across the ravaged terrain where, hidden from prying maniacal titans above in sunshine heavens with averted, blind eyes as if forewarned against such snooperbious endeavour of trespassing their domains.
Numerous cities abounded like anarchic colonies filled with venerated elven constructs whose inhale shaped crystalline facettism: skyscrapers that pierc'd to heavens; gardened castells; founatine towers reaching up to empyreal dome, for this mystic urban hatch'ried every age: modern cities founded centuries since elven times on sacred sits while elite races, each blessed divine forebear in line, resound in every inception with grace and masonic charm, leaving ashes aftermath's of aforementymuth: frenzymod infestation of forging'd sentie'les as steel servitors.

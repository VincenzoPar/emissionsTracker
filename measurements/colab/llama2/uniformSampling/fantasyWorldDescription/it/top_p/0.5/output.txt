C'è un elfo con un naso a punta, una strega con un volto sfigmico e un orco con le mani enormi e unghie aguzze.

Le creature ti guardano con sospetto e ti chiedono chi sei e che cosa ti porta nella loro valle. Ti senti in difficoltà, ma decidi di confidare loro la tua missione: cercare un antico manoscritto che si trova in un castello lontano, dove si nasconde un mistero che potrebbe minare l'equilibrio del mondo immaginario.

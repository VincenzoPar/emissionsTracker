The following repository contains measurement results obtained by running inference cycles as described in measurements_report.pdf.
The directory structure is as follows: measurements>hardware>LLM Model>Sampling Technique>Prompt Type>Measurement ID. For example,if I wanted to access measurements related to the generation of dance choreography, performed on the Google virtual machine with Latin Hypercube Sampling on Mistral, I would have to follow the path: measurements> colab> mistral>
latinHypercubeSampling > danceCoreography.
